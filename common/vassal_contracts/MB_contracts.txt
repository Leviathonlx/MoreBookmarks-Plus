#I didn't like how this isn't shown when a religion has the Jizya Contract parameter since then it means only tax jurisdictions can give the title revocation protection (and said tax decree also gives religious protection) but tax jurisdictions I can't easily edit via script like I can with these contracts plus they're for everyone in said jurisdiction and not specific titles and they are easily altered with no ramifications unlike vassal contracts which give tyranny. Religious rights isn't hidden like that so there's no reason to hide this one
