#When adding new bookmarks look at the error log for duplicate characters from vanilla files or other character errors like fathers being set as woman or people set as their own father. A bookmark WILL NOT LOAD if it has any assertion errors in the error log.
#The background for each date is a .dds file in \gfx\interface\bookmarks 
#Icons are set in \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_big and \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_buttons 
#Character portraits are set with the command dump_bookmark_portraits once you load a bookmark. Those go in bookmark_portraits and when generated go to \Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\common\bookmark_portraits in your documents directory
#Positions are updated in real time and aren't too hard to setup

##Consolidated Vanilla Bookmarks##
##Consolidating the vanilla bookmarks gives room for 4-5 bookmarks at actual new dates. Some irrelevent/less important characters were removed for space reasons. Also added characters in other regions to these bookmarks since they were incredibly Euro centric
