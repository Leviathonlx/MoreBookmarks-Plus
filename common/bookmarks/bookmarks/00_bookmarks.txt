#Bookmark Order#
# Bookmarks will show within a group in the order that they are in within this file
#

#Position
#position = { x (0 from left) y (0 from top) }

#When adding new bookmarks look at the error log for duplicate characters from vanilla files or other character errors like fathers being set as woman or people set as their own father. A bookmark WILL NOT LOAD if it has any assertion errors in the error log.
#The background for each date is a .dds file in \gfx\interface\bookmarks 
#Icons are set in \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_big and \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_buttons 
#Character portraits are set with the command dump_bookmark_portraits once you load a bookmark. Those go in bookmark_portraits and when generated go to \Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\common\bookmark_portraits in your documents directory
#Positions are updated in real time and aren't too hard to setup


##Bookmark Map Screen##
#Console command to make a map that can be used to make vanilla like bookmark screens
#
#map.savepng [<map mode>] [<file name>] [<yes/no> should render flat (optional)]
#Do yes for no barony borders and no for them existing
#Saves in the documents CK3 directory (\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III)
