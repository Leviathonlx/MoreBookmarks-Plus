 lesson_basics_quick_vassals: "Vassals"
 lesson_basics_quick_vassals_desc: "Notice how $c_ormond$ is included in the outline of your [realm|e] on the map despite not showing up in the [domain|e] view? To explain why that's the case, we'll need to look at your [vassals|e]."

 lesson_basics_quick_holdings_desc: "Currently, your [domain|E] consists of the [counties|E] (called 'Earldoms', due to your Irish [culture|E]) of $c_thomond$ and $c_ennis$. Since $c_ormond$ is held by your [vassal|e], it is not part of your $game_concept_domain$.\n\nThese [counties|E] are made up of smaller pieces of land — [baronies|E], the individual [holdings|E] of a [realm|E].\n\n#TUT Holdings represent settlements in your land!#!"
