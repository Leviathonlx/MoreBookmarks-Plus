#Travel Danger Events
#Sea: Someone falls overboard
 travel_danger_events.4000.t:0 "$travel_danger_prefix$ [overboard_character.GetWomanMan|U] Overboard!"
 travel_danger_events.4000.desc:0 "The choppy waters are enough to make any experienced sailor sea sick. As we roll back and forth on the waves, the people on the ship are slowly moving to seek shelter below.\n\nI notice [overboard_character.GetTitledFirstName] looking out over the railing before turning to make [overboard_character.GetHerHis] way towards the hull deck — but before anyone has time to react, the ship hurls sideways and [overboard_character.GetSheHe] falls into the dark water."
 travel_danger_events.4000.desc.again:0 "The sea is not kind to us on our way to [destination.GetNameNoTooltip]. As we keep experiencing turbulence in our seafaring, as soon as the captain yells out the warning people are faster to move below deck this time.\n\nHowever, [overboard_character.GetTitledFirstName] lingered for too long and falls overboard with a low #EMP splash#!!"
 travel_danger_events.4000.desc.seriously:0 "Somehow we must have invoked the fury of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WaterGodName]; the sea is once again storming and people hurriedly move below deck, before the captain even has time to shout the warning.\n\nAs I rush below deck, I catch a glimpse of [overboard_character.GetTitledFirstName] catching their foot on a stray rope from the railing. A crew member hurries to [overboard_character.GetHerHis] side, but it is too late and with the next toss of the vessel, [overboard_character.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] plunges into the depths!"
 travel_danger_events.4000.a:0 "We need to save [overboard_character.GetHerHim]!"
 travel_danger_events.4000.a_again:0 "Not again! Save [overboard_character.GetHerHim]!"

 #Illness, an entourage member falls ill
 travel_danger_events.4010.t:1 "$travel_danger_prefix$ This Is Fine"
 travel_danger_events.4010.desc:0 "Traveling through the, sometimes harsh, environments has invigorating effects on at least #EMP my#! state of mind and vigor.\n\nAs I glance over at [ill_character.GetTitledFirstName], however, [ill_character.GetSheHe] does not appear to be doing quite as good. [ill_character.GetHerHis|U] movement is labored, [ill_character.GetHerHis] breathing heavy and spontaneous bursts of coughing ripple through [ill_character.GetHerHis] body — clearly [ill_character.GetSheHe] is not well."
 travel_danger_events.4010.desc_again:0 "We are just about to break camp morning, on our way to [destination.GetNameNoTooltip], when I find [ill_character.GetTitledFirstName] in [ill_character.GetHerHis] lodgings, breathing heavily and pale as a sheet. [ill_character.GetSheHe|U] winces under my scrutiny, and lets out a bellowing cough.\n\nDid [ill_character.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] also contract something? Is this a plague?"
 travel_danger_events.4010.desc_sea:0 "As we sail towards [destination.GetNameNoTooltip], the fresh sea air is doing wonders for at least #EMP my#! health and well-being. However, we are not all so lucky.\n\nI have noticed how [ill_character.GetTitledFirstName] has been deteriorating over the past few days, and now there is no doubt that [ill_character.GetSheHe] has contracted an illness of some kind."
 travel_danger_events.4010.desc_sea_again:0 "We make good progress towards [destination.GetNameNoTooltip], which I find very invigorating. It would however seem as if my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('ill_character'))], [ill_character.GetTitledFirstName], is experiencing the opposite.\n\nThis morning I found [ill_character.GetHerHim] — leaning heavily on the railing with a rasping cough — and clearly [ill_character.GetSheHe] also seems to have contracted something. Is this a plague?"
 travel_danger_events.4010.a:0 "We should let [ill_character.GetHerHim] rest and recover fully."
 travel_danger_events.4010.a_sea:0 "Find a port so that [ill_character.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] may rest and recover fully."
