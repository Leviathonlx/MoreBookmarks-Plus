Also having to deal with my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('rival_at_court') )] [rival_at_court.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] mockery is too much. [rival_at_court.GetSheHe|U] goes out of [rival_at_court.GetHerHis] way to make my life as miserable as [rival_at_court.GetSheHe] can, now that I am brought so low."
 house_arrest_ongoing.0005.a:0 "It's working, too!"
