 prison.1001.rack.desc:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName] straps me to the rack [actor.GetHerselfHimself], a pleased smirk on [actor.GetHerHis] lips. "I trust you have heard the others. The screams, the snapping of bones and sinews."
 prison.1001.whip.desc:0 "[actor.GetTitledFirstName] twirls the whip in [actor.GetHerHis] hand. "Oh, the whip looks innocent enough, but it can separate flesh from bones just as well as any knife."

 prison.1002.rack.desc:0 "Why complicate matters? There is nothing like the good old rack. When the jailer hauls [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] into the room, [recipient.GetHerHis] eyes are immediately drawn to the big wooden frame."
 prison.1002.whip.desc:0 "Oh, the sweet kiss of the whip! It might look innocent, but it can separate flesh from bones just as well as any knife. Judging by the look on [recipient.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] face, [recipient.GetSheHe] knows this all too well."
 prison.1002.rats.desc:1 "The rats in the bucket might seem shy at first, but they will happily gnaw their way through a [recipient.GetWomanMan]'s chest once some heat is added. As I explain the concept to [recipient.GetTitledFirstName], [recipient.GetHerHis] resolve melts away before my eyes."
 prison.1002.poetry.desc:0 "When one can twist words for pleasure as well as myself, twisting them for harm is a simple matter.\n\nTaking out the long volume of poetry from my arm, I unfurl it, letting the scroll hit the floor and roll gently backwards out the door."

 prison.1003.rack.desc:0 "Why complicate matters? There is nothing like the good old rack. The sound when bones and sinews snap is quite unforgettable. But not as unforgettable as the pain [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] is soon to experience..."
 prison.1003.whip.desc:0 "Oh, the sweet kiss of the whip! It might look innocent, but it can separate flesh from bones just as well as any knife — a truth [recipient.GetTitledFirstName] is soon to experience. [recipient.GetSheHe|U] will be sleeping on [recipient.GetHerHis] stomach for quite some time..."
 prison.1003.rats.desc:0 ""These rats might seem shy," I say as I strap the bucket to [recipient.GetFirstNamePossessive] exposed chest.

 prison.9001.t:0 "Freedom!"
 prison.9001.desc_1:0 "I spend many days planning my escape, thinking about the best course of action and route of escape. It all amounts to nothing though as one day the guard simply forgets to lock the cell, staggering away without looking back."
 prison.9001.desc_2:0 "A nice word here, a heartfelt compliment there – soon the guard views me with warm familiarity instead of the initial suspicion [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] harbored. When I ask for a bit of fresh air [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] does not even question me, and I leave [dummy_gender.GetHerHim] face down in a ditch."
 prison.9001.desc_3_opening:0 "A moments distraction, that was all I needed to slip the keys from the guard's belt and behind my back."

 prison.9001.desc_3:0 "When darkness falls I make my way slowly out of my cell, wincing at the screech."
 prison.9001.desc_4:0 "I scour every inch of the cell. I inspect every hinge, feel along every bar, and investigate every chain. As darkness once again falls I finally find what I've been looking for – a loose stone! It is quick work to widen the hole into a tunnel after that."
 prison.9001.desc_5:0 "I stalk the place, every door as familiar as an old friend, and I bide my time. I know who goes where, and at what time. I know who calls upon specific servants, and I know the fastest route out of here. As darkness falls I simply wait for the perfect moment, and then I slip away like a shadow."
 prison.9001.desc_6:0 "I wait until darkness falls, and as soon as I am certain no one is around I grab one bar in each hand and #EMP bend#!. Sweat drips into my eyes, and my panting breath echoes in the darkness, but soon I have a hole just big enough to squeeze through."
 prison.9001.desc_7:0 "As soon as the guard leave I descend upon the lock. It's old and rusty, and all I have to work with is a small nail I found in the corner, but that will not stop me. A small twist, a tiny nudge, and– #EMP there!#!"
 prison.9001.desc_8:0 "I smile as the guard tries to stifle a yawn. I have kept the discussion going for hours by now, and I dive into the topic of [ROOT.Char.Custom('subject_of_interest')] without relenting. Soon [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] is nodding in [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] chair, and then it's a simple thing to get the keys of [dummy_gender.GetHerHim]."
 prison.9001.desc_9:0 "Many days of sly gazes, insinuating gestures, and invitations have finally born fruit, and as the guard approach me with one hand already unlacing [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] [dummy_gender.Custom('GetUpperClothingArticle')] I smile.

 prison.9502.desc_stone:0 "It bounces heavily off the guards helmet, but [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] only turns around with eyebrows raised in surprise.\n\nSpotting the stone [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] tosses it away with a sneer."
 prison.9502.desc_spoon:0 "It bounces off the guards helmet, and [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] barely seems to notice.\n\nTurning around and spotting the out of place spoon, [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] picks it up and stuffs it into [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] own belt."
 prison.9502.desc_cockroach:0 "It scrambles for purchase, but the movement must have alerted the guard for [dummy_gender.GetHerHis] hand comes up and mercilessly swat my beloved cockroach to the ground, stomping it into the ground with a disgusted sneer."
