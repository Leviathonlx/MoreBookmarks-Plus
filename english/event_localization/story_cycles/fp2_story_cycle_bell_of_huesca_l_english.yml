 bell_special_yearly.1000.desc:0 "My [steward.GetCouncilTitle] [steward.GetFirstName] has suggested I survey a nearby abandoned church from the time of the Visigoths.\n\nAmidst the barrel-vaulted ceiling and the horseshoe arches, there is a once-beauteous bell tower, with several ruined bells missing their clappers.\n\nAs I wander through the ruin, I hear a clattering of hooves. Peering through a hole, I see [faction_member_1.GetTitledFirstName] is approaching. Might [faction_member_1.GetSheHe] think this place could be a hideout for his traitorous faction?"

 bell_special_yearly.1000.a:0 "I could kill [faction_member_1.GetHerHim] with no one around to see!"
 bell_special_yearly.1000.a.tt:0 "You sneak up on [faction_member_1.GetTitledFirstName] and try to kill [faction_member_1.GetHerHim]"
 bell_special_yearly.1000.b:0 "I should quietly slink away."

 bell_special_yearly.1500.desc:0 "I hide in the church antechamber, and can her only the thudding of my murderous heart, and [faction_member_1.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] footsteps.\n\nAs [faction_member_1.GetSheHe] steps into the room, I strike [faction_member_1.GetHerHis] head with a piece of debris, and [faction_member_1.GetSheHe] is knocked to the ground.\n\nAs I strike again and again, a fleeting fancy clouds my blood-tinted visions. A dream of this old bell-tower making music again, with all of my foes' heads as the clappers."
 bell_special_yearly.1500.a:0 "Another fractious fool shall join my ensemble!"
 bell_special_yearly.1500.a.tt:0 "You seek out another victim."
 bell_special_yearly.1500.discovery.tt:0 "Your chances of discovery increase"
 bell_special_yearly.1500.b:0 "I should return home and rest."
 bell_special_yearly.1500.b.tt:0 "You stop collecting heads for the bell."

 bell_special_yearly.2000.desc:1 "I demand the loathsome [faction_member_2.GetTitledFirstName] visit my [ROOT.Char.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] and disguise myself as a troubadour. In costume, I declaim '[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName] demands you hear this wondrous new composition invented here in the capital!'\n\nOnce [faction_member_2.GetSheHe] is inside, I force [faction_member_2.GetHerHim] into a chamber alone. There I play the most mundane #italic cansos#! I can for hours until the sod falls asleep.\n\nI work quickly — I strangle my foe with one of the lute-strings, hide the head [Select_CString(ROOT.Char.IsFemale,'under my dress','in my mantle')], and bolt away through the halls before anyone can blink."
 bell_special_yearly.2000.a:0 "The Bell doesn't have enough heads yet!"
 bell_special_yearly.2000.b:0 "This is a beautiful crime — I shouldn't risk it souring."

#Dropping an organ out of a window
 bell_special_yearly.3000.desc:0 "I have imposed a royal visit on [faction_member_3.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [faction_member_3.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] under pretense of attempting to dispel tension with [faction_member_3.GetHerHis] rebellious faction. During a pause in our negotiations, I examine [faction_member_3.GetHerHis] music rooms, and ask to be left alone to play.\n\nThe music room has a large window above the [faction_member_3.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')] garden — with quite a large pipe organ next to it. The moment is too perfect.\n\nAs [faction_member_3.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] walks out beneath the window to take a moment of solace, I push the organ. It careens through the air, and crushes [faction_member_3.GetHerHim] below. Giggling, I hurry to collect the head before the death is noticed."
 bell_special_yearly.3000.a:0 "The Bell is going to be exquisite!"
 bell_special_yearly.3000.b:0 "Freak organ accidents happen every day."

 bell_special_yearly.4000.desc:0 "I lounge in my garden, absent-mindedly playing with the roses, pulling their heads off one by one.\n\nI wonder what to do with my bell-tower. Is it ever destined to perform?"
 bell_special_yearly.4000.desc_discoverer:0 "\n\nWhile I mill this over, I notice [bell_discoverer.GetTitledFirstName], one of the sods still mourning a victim of the disappearances, staring at me in the garden. I chuckle, and almost want to tell [bell_discoverer.GetHerHim] on the spot."
 bell_special_yearly.4000.a:0 "I should put on a grand concert at the church!"
 bell_special_yearly.4000.a.tt:0 "Everyone becomes aware of your killings."

 bell_special_yearly.5000.desc:0 "I ride out one night to visit my bell and bask in its resplendent villainy. To my surprise, there are torches flickering already as I enter the ruin.\n\nAt first, I imagine the ghosts of the Visigoths are displeased I have defiled their church, but then [bell_discoverer.GetTitledFirstName] pulls back a hood. "I feel I have traveled to [bell_discoverer.GetFaith.NegativeAfterLife] and will be there all my life, after uncovering the abomination you have wrought. You shall join your victims, creature!"\n\nI am briefly aware of a slice of steel through my neck, and then nothing at all."
 bell_special_yearly.5000.a:0 "Play me out, [bell_discoverer.GetTitledFirstName]."


 bell_special_yearly.6000.desc:0 "A concert is held in the Visigothic ruin for all my court, promising a night of music in an old candlelit church.\n\nThe usual fare with minstrels proceeds while a few guests complain of the peculiar smell. We enjoy some light tunes with flutes and plucked strings, and the pieces become more mournful as the night goes on.\n\nAt the finale, servants follow my command to rush and ring the bells in time with the last song. The screams of my courtiers join the voice of the choir as all behold my rattling, chiming heads!"
 bell_special_yearly.6000.a:0 "Such music!"
 bell_special_yearly.6000.b:0 "The rest of you will join them, if you defy me!"
