 tax_rivalry.0011.t: "$tax_rivalry.t$: Making Amends"
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_intro: "[forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstName|U] has long been a silver thorn in my side, but perhaps it does not always have to be this way."
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_opinion: "We are hardly on bad terms at all, and with a little due diligence might even become valuable allies of one another if only we end this feud."
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_compassion: "I'm certainly not one to quarrel for extended periods, but can I trust [forgiven_rival.GetHerHim] to be as open-minded as I am?"
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_unity: "For the good of the clan, I might make amends with [forgiven_rival.GetHerHim], if only in our public lives. But will [forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] feel the same way?"
 tax_rivalry.0011.desc_fallback: "I can reach out to [forgiven_rival.GetHerHim] to make amends, but who knows whether [forgiven_rival.GetSheHe] will accept my olive branch?"
 tax_rivalry.0011.a: "Let us see what [forgiven_rival.GetSheHe] thinks of my idea."
 tax_rivalry.0011.a.tt_ai: "I will ask [forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] to put our bad blood aside."
 tax_rivalry.0011.a.tt_player: "[forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip|U] will ultimately decide how to respond."
 tax_rivalry.0011.a.failure: "[forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] scorns my offer"
 tax_rivalry.0011.b: "[forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip|U] will taste my vengeance yet!"
 tax_rivalry.0011.b.tt: "Our bitter rivalry will resume."

 tax_rivalry.0012.desc_intro_unfriendly: "While I normally spurn any mention of [forgiving_rival.GetTitledFirstName] a certain mood possessed me to accept [forgiving_rival.GetHerHis] sudden visit to my courtyard."
 tax_rivalry.0012.desc_intro_friendly: "While [forgiving_rival.GetTitledFirstName] and I have not been close ever since our disputes began, still I appreciated [forgiving_rival.GetHerHis] sudden visit to my courtyard."
 tax_rivalry.0012.desc_outro: "There we dined in unseasonably pleasant weather until [forgiving_rival.GetSheHe] cleared [forgiving_rival.GetHerHis] throat:\n\n"Were we not engaged in this dispute, then we might enjoy many more afternoons like this. So won't you forgive my past foolishness, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]?""
 tax_rivalry.0012.a: "If you forgive mine as well."
 tax_rivalry.0012.b: "Servants, escort [forgiving_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] to the door."

 tax_rivalry.0013.desc_intro: "[forgiven_rival.GetTitledFirstName|U] has agreed to my proposal, and as of today our pecuniary disputes are in the past."
 tax_rivalry.0013.desc_outro_neutral: "Let us hope that our past bitterness will not color our relations going forward..."
 tax_rivalry.0013.desc_outro_vengeful: "After all, there will be plenty of other opportunities to silence [forgiven_rival.GetHerHim] without [forgiven_rival.GetHerHis] knowing..."
 tax_rivalry.0013.a: "One can only hope."

 tax_rivalry.0014.desc: "It seems that, for the good of the realm, [forgiven_rival.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] and [forgiving_rival.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] have put their petty dispute aside. Only time will tell, though, whether spare embers might light this fire once more."
 tax_rivalry.0014.a: "We shall see."

 tax_rivalry.1000.t: "$tax_rivalry.t$: Blind Spot"
 tax_rivalry.1000.desc: "[steward.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive|U] and [tax_collector.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] quarrels have proven injurious to the realm's finances. Neither wishes to correspond with the other, and as a result payments are often overridden, misplaced, and even lost.\n\nAs I grumble over this, I spy the pair's own contributions to the realm. How easy it would be to "lose" this sum and have each blame the other for its disappearance..."
 tax_rivalry.1000.b: "I should scold them for this oversight."
 tax_rivalry.1000.b.tt: "I order [steward.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] and [tax_collector.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] to cease their rivalry."

 tax_rivalry.1001.desc: "The taxes due to [liege.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] have gone missing at precisely the same moment that [other_rival.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] paid [other_rival.GetHersHis]!\n\nWith no evidence to suggest otherwise, I can only assume that this is a plot of [other_rival.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] to slander my good name and treasury."
 tax_rivalry.1001.a: "That [other_rival.Custom('InsultNoun')]!"

 tax_rivalry.1002.desc: ""You two are becoming sloppy," [liege.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] pushes a bag of gold towards our end of the table. "It would have been too easy for me to seize your contributions and blame the other for its disappearance, so little do you communicate. See to it that you end these petty disputes."\n\n[liege.GetSheHe|U] grabs the sack and pockets it, glaring at us."
 tax_rivalry.1002.a: "It will not happen again."

 tax_rivalry.3001.t: "$tax_rivalry.t$: The Rabble"
 tax_rivalry.3001.desc_intro: "As I brood over my grievances with [sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], a dastardly plan occurs to me. With only a little bribe, I can convince the peasantry of [sabotaged_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] that [sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] intends to quintuple their taxes and inspire a rebellion against our liege [liege.GetTitledFirstName]."
 tax_rivalry.3001.desc_outro_assigned: "Naturally, the blame will fall upon that [sabotaged_rival.Custom('InsultNoun')] for mismanaging the county."
 tax_rivalry.3001.desc_outro_fallback: "It matters not that [sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] is not actually in charge of the county, the damage will be done."

 tax_rivalry.3002.desc: "Foul [saboteur.Custom('InsultNoun')]! [saboteur.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] has spread false information that I am increasing taxes in the [sabotaged_county.GetName]. Now a mob has formed against my liege, and no manner of words can smooth over [liege.GetHerHis] wrath."
 tax_rivalry.3002.a: "It was all [saboteur.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] doing!"

 tax_rivalry.3003.desc: "Oh the buffoonery... now the [sabotaged_county.GetName] has formed a rabble against my name, all because they believed [sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstName] would increase their taxes!\n\n[sabotaged_rival.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip|U] is claiming that this is the work of [saboteur.GetTitledFirstName], but one thing is clear: the pair's rivalry is quickly spiraling out of control."
 tax_rivalry.3003.a: "To arms!"
 tax_rivalry.3003.a.tt: "A [peasant_faction|E] will rise against you in [sabotaged_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]"

 tax_rivalry.9000.desc: "No longer must I endure the [less_fortunate_rival.Custom('quirk_neg_noun')] of [less_fortunate_rival.GetTitledFirstName].
