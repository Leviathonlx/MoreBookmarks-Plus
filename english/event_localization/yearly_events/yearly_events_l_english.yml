#Abandoned inn
 yearly.0025.t.chain_title: "Inn Keeping"
 yearly.0025.t: "$yearly.0025.t.chain_title$: Old & Forgotten"
 yearly.0025.desc: "Strolling down a lonely back road of [county.GetBaseNameNoTier] with my retinue, I see a dark silhouette forming in the distance, slowly creeping in at the pace of my own footsteps.\n\nThe closer I get, the clearer I see - this is an old tavern, abandoned and forgotten. With a little bit of love and care to this old facade, it could easily become a delightful little inn.\n\nI cannot imagine quite why this place has become so dilapidated. Its position is close to several villages, the doorway looks welcoming. It seems, for all the world, like it should be earning ample coin.\n\nWith the right land[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]."
 yearly.0025.a: "I shall make this place thrive!"
 yearly.0025.a.tt.progress: "Invest resources to restore the inn, either gain a #N bad#!, #M average#! or #P good#! outcome and rewards."
 yearly.0025.b: "Move along, it's too much of a risk"

#Refurbishment
 yearly.0026.t: "$yearly.0025.t.chain_title$: Refurbishment"
 yearly.0026.desc: "When entering this husk of a building, I quickly realize why it was lost and forsaken in the first place.\n\nThere is a faint smell of something I don't recognize, combined with leaking holes in the ceiling dripping ever so faintly against the muddy indoor swamp that passes for a floor.\n\nFixing it wouldn't be #EMP too#! hard, but it seems frustrating and expensive. Either way, the people of [county.GetNameNoTier] will surely flock here — a new business endorsed by the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] has a certain novelty to it."
 yearly.0026.a: "Just... throw some hay on the mud"
 yearly.0026.a.tt.success: "I make due with what I got"
 yearly.0026.a.tt.failure: "I don't find a good solution"

#Edibles
 yearly.0027.t: "$yearly.0025.t.chain_title$: Feast Like a [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetQueenKing')|U]"
 yearly.0027.desc: "I start to drift off, thinking about the potential of the place and all the memories to be had within.\n\nOf course, few things enhances a good night like a hearty meal, and nothing washes away sorrows faster than a mug of fine ale. A good hunk of greasy meat, a drunk passed out on a bench, new friends with blurry faces — all the ingredients of a good time!\n\nThe real question is, what should I let the guests indulge in: beer, wine, spirits..."
 yearly.0027.a: "Who cares about #EMP drink#!, I'll be there!"

 innkeeper_bad_edibles_char_modifier: "Frugal Host"
 innkeeper_bad_edibles_char_modifier_desc: "The selection of food on offer at this character's inn had more mold than meat."
 innkeeper_neutral_edibles_char_modifier: "Balanced Diet"

#Entertainment
 yearly.0028.t: "$yearly.0025.t.chain_title$: On With the Show!"
 yearly.0028.desc: "An inn surely wouldn’t be complete without some sort of entertainment for the throng.\n\nWhat about a singing bard, talking about feelings of both love and war? Or perhaps a poet, who could inspire others about the weight of words? Why not an agile jester, to make you cry out of joy and make your sorrows go away — if only for a night?\n\nI've got to consider what type of performance is needed for the patrons to stay enthralled. The longer they are here, the more they'll drink."
 yearly.0028.a: "Hire an eloquent bard"
 yearly.0028.b: "Find a talented poet"

#Conclusion
 yearly.0029.t: "$yearly.0025.t.chain_title$: Opening Night"
 yearly.0029.conclusion_intro: "It's been a long tiring evening for the tavern's debut — filled with ups and downs. To be expected, but still, exhausting."
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_bad.1: "My new inn has presumably seen better days. Today was not one of them.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_bad.2: "I had hoped the leak might hold. Alas, there is more rain on the bar than beer.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_bad.3: "The smell simply will not abate. I fear that it will haunt my dreams, forever.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_average.1: "A few stools have been stolen, though it leaves an excuse to invest in more.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_average.2: "A few crude etchings on tables, but nothing of note.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_average.3: "Thankfully our repairs held, despite the ominous creaking of the roof.\n\n" 
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_good.1: "A worthwhile investment to do those repairs.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_good.2: "A few more places to sit wouldn't hurt.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.refurbishment_good.3: "Thankfully, the last patron just left with a smile on their face.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_bad.1: "The food went down poorly... most of it leaking between the floorboards.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_bad.2: "The few patrons that dared to order a meal couldn't even pluck up the courage to take a bite.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_bad.3: "Every unattended platter was a miniature feast for the local rats. Hordes, and hordes of #EMP rats.#!\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_average.1: "The patrons seems to have enjoyed most of the food, despite warding off a couple of brave rats.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_average.2: "Some guests questioned the beer they were served, frowning after taking a sniff, before pouring it into their mouths regardless.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_average.3: "Even if neither the food nor beer was by any means fantastic, the punters seem to have been in high spirits. Many literally.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_good.1: "The innkeeper had a difficult time keeping up with the demand, as the patrons barely sat down before ordering another round.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_good.2: "All the cheering has damned-near turned me deaf, so long and loud did it go on.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.edibles_good.3: "Not a single plate that was served came back with even as much as a crumb.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_bard_bad: "When the bard took center stage, [entertainer.GetSheHe] seemed... nervous, as though [entertainer.GetSheHe]'d never played to a crowd prior. Eyes afright as though [entertainer.GetSheHe]'d taken to the battlefield, [entertainer.GetSheHe] let out a single, piercing shriek — and fled.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_bard_average: "The bard entered the stage with a somewhat confident strut, pulling up a stool from the ground and smashing it down with one of [entertainer.GetHerHis] heavy boots on top of it. As soon as [entertainer.GetSheHe]’d brought forward [entertainer.GetHerHis] lute, the prior confidence in [entertainer.GetHerHis] posture faded. The crowd was greeted with a warbling, screechy ballad that not even a dying, deaf grandparent would have appreciated.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_bard_good: "Early on, a faint melody could be heard from the gloom outside, slowly grabbing the attention of every drunk. A hush settled over the crowd, and all eyes became fixed on the way in. The song became louder, louder still, till the door flew open and a handsome bard entered. [entertainer.GetHerHis|U] refrain rose to a crescendo, then crashed down into a jaunty tune and a chorus of raucous cheers — the first of many to come.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_poet_bad: "The poet entered the stage with a scrap of parchment in [entertainer.GetHerHis] hands, doing [entertainer.GetHerHis] utmost to get the attention of the crowd before starting, to little avail. [entertainer.GetSheHe] took a closer look at [entertainer.GetHerHis] notes, tried to squeak out a few lines directly — only to be drowned out by a chorus of boos, and flee weeping into the night.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_poet_average: "The poet's radiant aura drew eyes as soon as [entertainer.GetSheHe] entered, making even the dullest patron look up from their mugs at all the fuss. As soon as the poet started to recite, the spell broke: with nothing but a dirge to entice them, the clueless crowd quickly lost interest and returned to their ale.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_poet_good: "The poet dramatically strode onto the stage, reciting [entertainer.GetHerHis] lines with such fiery passion that not a heart present was left unstirred. [entertainer.GetHerHis|U] words rang so heavily against us, all prior emotions seemed... weightless, by comparison. Not a single soul left the establishment that day without a tear in their eye — be it of joy or sadness.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_jester_bad: "I’d been fooled by the fool for believing that [entertainer.GetSheHe]’d turn up for the evening, while in fact no trace could lead back to [entertainer.GetHerHim]. The anticipation for the night’s entertainment quickly turned sour, with the ornery crowd grumbling in disbelief at my miserly excuses.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_jester_average: "The jester managed to make the atmosphere a bit lighter within the inn, but at the cost of some occasional awkward silences and jokes that went over the heads of simple-minded — and simply inebriated — peasants.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.entertainment_jester_good: "The jester swept onto the stage with a yell and a cartwheel. The entire inn erupted in cries and applause as [entertainer.GetSheHe] did twirl gracefully through the air, jumping across tables, stools, and patrons alike. Every other feat was combined with a witty quip (even whilst gasping for air), leaving the poor fool exhausted by the night's end. It turned out to be a rather breathtaking evening for everybody involved.\n\n"
 yearly.0029.conclusion_outro: "My work here is done."
 yearly.0029.a: "What a night!"
