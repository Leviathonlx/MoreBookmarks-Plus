 journey_events.10.t: "An Outdoor's Companion"
 journey_events.10.desc: ""My liege, I have noticed you are in dire need of a traveling companion." I hear my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('provider_character'))], [provider_character.GetFirstName], say as [provider_character.GetSheHe] enters my study. [provider_character.GetSheHe|U] gives me a knowing look, "There's a merchant caravan passing by [ROOT.Char.GetCapitalLocation.GetName] today, and I saw they had a large selection of animals at sale."\n\nAs I ask for more details, [provider_character.GetSheHe] mentions the dogs, horses, and falcons of all sizes that [provider_character.GetSheHe] saw. Reflecting on it, I think to myself, maybe a companion for my travels is just what I need."
 journey_events.10.a: "A proper war horse, that would be perfect."
 journey_events.10.b: "Now dogs, they are real companions."

 journey_events.11.desc: "After a day or two, I am finally presented with a large, powerful horse. As soon as it is handed over to me, I feel the willful beast straining against me.\n\nFor a moment, I am worried that I will be tossed off, but in the end, I manage to hold on, albeit barely. The beast then looks at me with what I can only describe as a glimmer of respect."
 journey_events.11.a: "I think we will be good friends, in time."

 journey_events.12.t: "An Outdoor's Companion: Dog"
 journey_events.12.desc: "After a day or two, I am finally presented with a small box. It wiggles slightly as I come closer, and after some hesitation, I finally open it to find my new little companion.\n\nAs soon as the lid is removed, the puppy jumps out and begins running around the room energetically. After a minute or so, it stops, flops down on the side, and starts to doze off."
 journey_events.12.a: "It is a bit small, isn't it?"

 journey_events.20.t: "In the Skies Above"
 journey_events.20.desc: "It has gotten quite late in the day, when my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('informer_character'))] [informer_character.GetFirstName] approaches me with a glimmer in [informer_character.GetHerHis] eyes.\n\n"My liege, I have heard a rumor that might interest you."\n\n[informer_character.GetSheHe|U] then shares how [informer_character.GetSheHe] came over a story about astronomical phenomena appearing in the skies above [destination_province.GetName] regularly as of recent.

 journey_events.50.desc: "I have long pondered how my subjects engage with one another, out of the sight of their betters. After due consideration, I have found the right moment to slip out, and some dingy scraps of cloth that I can use as a disguise.\n\nBut as the moment gets ever closer, I am starting to reconsider.

 journey_events.51.desc: "I find a seedy yet popular building as I travel through the streets.

Nobody has given me a second glance throughout the whole process.\n\nI sit by myself, watching the others at the establishment. A loud group is gathered around a large table, where several peasants seem to be enjoying themselves over some dice game."

It looks to be a plan for a new building in [journey_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip], with such advanced features that I would expect to see from the mind of a master architect. None of the students look past the age of 18, but have already mastered a craft that would take most a lifetime."

Their soft hymns fill the air, though I cannot make out if they are singing in praise of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] or another deity. Upon closer inspection, I realize some peasants are of higher stature, with some even wearing the garb of nobility. Nonetheless, all seem to be in a state of peace, with their reverence of the divine binding them together."
 journey_events.60.desc_egalitarian: "I decide to take a quick stop at a local tavern, walking directly into a discussion. From their accents and garments alike, the patrons share few similarities. Yet, the discussion is rather civil and lively, and there seems to be no judgement, as if they've all came from the same womb.
