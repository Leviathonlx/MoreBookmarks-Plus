 stewardship_domain.1052.desc:0 "Vermin have infested several granaries in the [target_county.GetName], destroying the seed grain stored in them.

 stewardship_domain.1053.t:0 "Corrupt Tax Collector"
 stewardship_domain.1053.desc:0 "I have noticed various inconsistencies and omissions in the tax records for [target_county.GetNameNoTier]. It is clear these errors cannot be simple mistakes — someone has been embezzling funds!\n\nUnfortunately, the trail of this mysterious culprit is erratic enough that it is difficult for me to determine exactly which tax collector is responsible."

 stewardship_domain.1073.t:0 "Culture Clash"
 stewardship_domain.1073.desc:0 "Most of the commoners living in [target_county.GetName] are of [target_ruler.GetCulture.GetName] descent. Proud of their traditions, it does not sit well with them that they must serve a foreigner like myself when my neighbor [target_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] shares their culture and history."
 stewardship_domain.1073.a:0 "Teach them the superiority of the [me.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] culture!"
 stewardship_domain.1073.a.success:0 "The commoners adopt [me.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] customs"
 stewardship_domain.1073.a.failure:0 "The commoners refuse to be civilized"

 stewardship_domain.6001.t:0 "Drainage"
 stewardship_domain.6001.desc:0 "Some months ago [baron.GetTitledFirstName] began an elaborate effort to clear marshland for settlement in [barony.GetNameNoTier]. Heavy plows and fresh ditches make the ground firm, but it is slow work.\n\n[baron.GetFirstName] has now written my [steward.GetCouncilTitle], to request that [baron.GetHerHis] levy duties be reduced. Being anxious to complete the works before next harvest, [baron.GetSheHe] hopes to instead recruit soldiers for labor."
 stewardship_domain.6001.a:0 "Take all the commoners you need, [baron.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 stewardship_domain.6001.b:0 "The entirety of [county.GetNameNoTier] could do with that."

 stewardship_domain.6002.t:0 "Clearing"
 stewardship_domain.6002.desc:0 "Some months ago [baron.GetTitledFirstName] began clearing land in the forests of [barony.GetNameNoTier] to prepare for settlement. Trees are uprooted, paths are cut, and ground is swailed.\n\n[baron.GetFirstName] has now written [steward.GetCouncilTitle] [steward.GetFirstName], to request that [baron.GetHerHis] levy duties be reduced. Being anxious to complete the works before next harvest, [baron.GetSheHe] hopes to instead recruit soldiers for labor."

 stewardship_domain.6011.b:1 "[steward.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], earn me their allegiance!"

 stewardship_domain.6012.desc:0 "The leader of the masons seemed reluctant to strike any kind of deal on behalf of the guild, until I pointed out exactly how much it would benefit us both."
 stewardship_domain.6012.a:0 "I did not even have to resort to threats of violence!"

 stewardship_domain.6013.desc:0 "After a lengthy audience, the chief mason will budge no further.\n\n"For a lower price than this, it cannot be done.""
 stewardship_domain.6013.a:0 ""Then we have an agreement.""
 stewardship_domain.6013.b:0 "Surely I can find cheaper masons somewhere else."

 stewardship_domain.6014.desc:0 ""You insult me and my entire profession, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]!" The chief mason is not at all pleased with the offers I am willing to make. "In fact, prices are on the rise. Simply the cost of labor, of course. I am sure the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleTierName] understands.""
 stewardship_domain.6014.a:0 ""I understand perfectly.""
 stewardship_domain.6014.b:1 "The [county.GetTierAsNameNoTooltip|l] serves me, and so will the guilds!"

 stewardship_domain.6015.desc:1 "The chief mason must have enjoyed the company of my [steward.GetCouncilTitle] [steward.GetTitledFirstName], because [steward.GetSheHe] has returned with a deal from the masons that even exceeds my demands."
 stewardship_domain.6015.a:0 "I could scarce have negotiated better myself!"

 stewardship_domain.6016.desc:0 "[steward.GetTitledFirstName] has returned to me with an offer from the masons' guild.\n\n"I inspected their records, my liege. I do not believe a better deal can be struck.""
 stewardship_domain.6016.a:0 "This sounds very good."
 stewardship_domain.6016.b:0 "Then I was a fool to send you, [steward.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"

 stewardship_domain.6017.desc:0 ""Negotiations did not go... entirely as planned, my liege." My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('steward'))] sounds apologetic. "However, I do have an offer, even if the mason's guild refuses to speak to me further.""
 stewardship_domain.6017.a:0 "I have to come to terms with what my servants accomplish."
 stewardship_domain.6017.b:0 "I will speak to them, then! I will order them!"

 stewardship_domain_special.1002.desc:0 "Apparently the [development_county.GetName] has caught its misfortune partly from bad management. Land was not properly cleared, seeds were sown out of season, and the pastures were over-grazed."

 stewardship_domain_special.1002.c:0 "You have forfeited your claim to [development_county.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip]!"
 stewardship_domain_special.1002.c.tt:0 "I take the [development_county.GetName] from [county_holder.GetTitledFirstName]"
 
 stewardship_domain_special.1003.desc:1 ""Thank you for believing in me, [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeAddress', county_holder)]!"\n\n[county_holder.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] has managed to solve the crisis [county_holder.GetSheHe] found [county_holder.GetHerselfHimself] in. Sometimes the best course of action is to trust in the skills of others, and then learn from them!"
 stewardship_domain_special.1003.a:0 "Tell me all about how you did it!"

 stewardship_domain_special.1004.desc:0 "The reports from the [development_county.GetName] only grow more disastrous, and it soon becomes evident that [county_holder.GetTitledFirstName] has only made the situation worse."
 stewardship_domain_special.1004.a:0 "What kind of [county_holder.GetTitleTierName] is [county_holder.GetSheHe]?!"

 stewardship_domain_special.1005.desc:0 "As I watch the [development_county.GetName] flourish under my guidance I cannot help but feel pride in what I have accomplished. To dabble in lesser management from time to time is a good way to learn!"
 stewardship_domain_special.1005.a:0 "This knowledge will be useful indeed!"

 stewardship_domain_special.1006.desc:0 "No matter what I try the [development_county.GetName] cannot find any respite. It is not as badly off as before, but I am at a loss as for how to solve the remaining tasks before me."
 stewardship_domain_special.1006.a:0 "Well, I cannot always succeed..."

 stewardship_domain_special.1104.desc_silk:0 ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], what are we supposed to do with all this silk?"\n\nApparently, the demand for silk was not high in the area, and [second_local_baron.GetTitledFirstName] is left with a lot of the expensive cloth unsold."

 stewardship_domain_special.1107.desc_religious_other:0 ""My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], what are we supposed to do with these blasphemous trinkets?"\n\nThe foreign items only repulsed the people — discouraging them from visiting the market.
