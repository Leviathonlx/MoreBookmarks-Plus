 mystic_lifestyle.1001.desc:0 "My preparations for my mystical communion is well underway when [SCOPE.sC('priest').Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )] approaches me.\n\n"I do not believe what you are doing to be entirely... orthodox," [priest.GetSheHe] tells me. "A good [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip] would refrain from this kind of behavior.""
 mystic_lifestyle.1001.a:0 "This brings me closer to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] than you could ever hope!"
 mystic_lifestyle.1001.b:0 "Of course. What was I thinking?"
 mystic_lifestyle.1001.b.flavor:0 "Telling [priest.GetHerHim] you were thinking of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate] is probably not going to go over well"

 mystic_lifestyle.1002.opening:0 "[SCOPE.sC('religious_head').Custom2('AppropriateGreeting', ROOT.Char)]"
 mystic_lifestyle.1002.desc:0 "It has come to my attention that you regularly engage in some most unusual forms of prayer.\n\nI demand that you end this ridiculous practice, and do appropriate penance for this misinterpretation of our faith."
 mystic_lifestyle.1002.a:0 "I know the will of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] better even than you!"

 mystic_lifestyle.1003.opening:0 "To my woefully misguided [SCOPE.sC('vassal').Custom2('RelationToMeShort', ROOT.Char )]"
 mystic_lifestyle.1003.desc:0 "Your strange practices are not sanctioned by the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural], and someone must take you to task for it. If I do not do it now, then [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] will.\n\nPlease see reason and turn away from this strange path. Who knows what heresy or demon worship it may lead to!"
 mystic_lifestyle.1003.a:1 "Your ignorance of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNamePossessive] secrets will not deter me!"

 mystic_lifestyle.1004.t:0 "$mystic_lifestyle_communion_header$Rumors"
 mystic_lifestyle.1004.desc:0 "It seems that my slightly unusual religious habits are catching more and more people's attentions.\n\nThat is hardly a problem — they couldn't hope to understand what I'm doing — but the whispers say that I am #EMP doing#! things behind closed doors, and that people should keep an eye out."
 mystic_lifestyle.1004.a:0 "I couldn't care less what they whisper."
 mystic_lifestyle.1004.b:0 "If I am open and welcoming, perhaps they would understand?"

 mystic_lifestyle.1005.opening:0 "My dear [SCOPE.sC('vassal').Custom2('RelationToMeShort', ROOT.Char )]"
 mystic_lifestyle.1005.desc:0 "I do not profess to fully understand your habits and practices. However, I must applaud you for the obvious effort you put into your prayers.\n\nIf only every true believer was as devout as you."
 mystic_lifestyle.1005.a:0 "It pleases me that you recognize my effort."
 mystic_lifestyle.1005.b:0 "Let me teach you how it's done!"

 mystic_lifestyle.1006.t:0 "$mystic_lifestyle_communion_header$A Reputation"
 mystic_lifestyle.1006.desc:0 "With my mystical practices, I have apparently developed quite a reputation. People don't know what it is I do, exactly, but they know that they don't want to cross me and find out.\n\nIt's ridiculous, but perhaps it's not entirely a bad thing..."
 mystic_lifestyle.1006.a:0 "They can be as afraid as their little souls make them."
 mystic_lifestyle.1006.b:0 "Swearing that I do no harm will put them at ease."

 mystic_lifestyle.1007.t:0 "$mystic_lifestyle_communion_header$Something Wrong"
 mystic_lifestyle.1007.desc:0 "My communions with the divine have been different lately. They no longer make me feel ecstatic, but instead weak.\n\nToday, I cannot even muster the strength to rise from bed."
 mystic_lifestyle.1007.a:0 "Servants... Help..."

 mystic_lifestyle.1008.t:0 "$mystic_lifestyle_communion_header$A Miracle"
