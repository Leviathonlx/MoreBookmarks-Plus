 diplomacy_generic.0012.start.desc:0 "The first time it happened, I barely even gave it a moment's thought, but [disobedient_subject.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] has grown bolder. [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis|U] challenges no longer pass unnoticed"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.council.desc:0 "at the council table."
 diplomacy_generic.0012.vassal.desc:0 "among my vassals."
 diplomacy_generic.0012.end.desc:0 "\n\n[disobedient_subject.GetSheHe|U] is testing my limits. The others are sure to follow — unless I give [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] a taste of [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] own medicine..."
 diplomacy_generic.0012.a:0 "I will ignore [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] and steal [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] ideas."
 make_invisible_option.tt:2 "You guess [disobedient_subject.GetFirstName] is unassertive, lethargic, or unambitious"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.b:0 "Mocking [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] [disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')] will shut [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] up."
 ridicule_option.tt:2 "You guess [disobedient_subject.GetFirstName] is self-conscious and cares about what others think"
 diplomacy_generic.0012.c:0 ""Forgetting" to invite [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] leaves [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] in the dark."

 diplomacy_generic.0012.h:1 ""How dare you challenge your #EMP [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]#!!?""
 diplomacy_generic.0012.tt:0 "Not very diplomatic, but effective nonetheless..."

 diplomacy_generic.0012.failure.desc:1 "You failed to manipulate [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName]"

 diplomacy_generic.0013.t:0 "Puppet on a String"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.make_invisible.desc:0 "It seems as if my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))] [suppressor.GetTitledFirstName] has lost interest in my opinion. When I speak up, [suppressor.GetSheHe] interrupts me or shifts [suppressor.GetHerHis] attention to something else. But sometimes, it appears [suppressor.GetSheHe] does listen, for [suppressor.GetSheHe] repeats my ideas and claims them as [suppressor.GetHerHis] own..."
 diplomacy_generic.0013.ridicule.desc:0 "What do I have to do to be taken seriously by my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))]? Whenever I speak, [suppressor.GetTitledFirstName] interrupts me to mock my ideas or my "[disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')].""
 diplomacy_generic.0013.withhold_information.desc:0 "Lately, everyone seems to be in the know but me! I look like a right fool when I constantly have to ask [suppressor.GetTitledFirstName] for clarifications in meetings or when I base suggestions on old information. I fear my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))] is deliberately keeping things from me."
 diplomacy_generic.0013.impossible_task.desc:0 "My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))], [suppressor.GetTitledFirstName], keeps giving me tasks which are impossible to complete in time! When I try to do them thoroughly I am lazy, and when I hurry [suppressor.GetSheHe] thinks me sloppy."
 diplomacy_generic.0013.shame.desc:0 "Whenever there is a problem, [suppressor.GetTitledFirstName] seems to think I am the one to blame. However, when I am the one to bring up issues, [suppressor.GetSheHe] accuses me of putting focus on the wrong things!"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.objectification.desc:0 "When my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('suppressor'))] calls to a meeting, I get a sinking feeling in my stomach. Over the last few weeks, there has been more than one comment regarding my "[disobedient_subject.Custom('ObjectifiedFeature')]", and when I speak [suppressor.GetSheHe] spends more time ogling than listening. Why does [suppressor.GetTitledFirstName] care more about my physical body than what I do and say?"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.threat.desc:0 "Lately, I have noticed this strange look upon [suppressor.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] face whenever I speak, a combination of exasperation and anger. Yet, I did not know for sure that something was amiss until today. When I disagreed with [suppressor.GetHerHim] in a meeting, [suppressor.GetSheHe] threatened to have me flogged!"
 diplomacy_generic.0013.a:0 "Two can play this game."

 diplomacy_generic.0014.t:1 "$diplomacy_generic.0012.t$: Master of Suppression"
 diplomacy_generic.0014.make_invisible.desc:0 "Whenever [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] have raised [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] voice to speak, I have yawned, turned my attention somewhere else, or outright interrupted [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]. As the others began to follow my example, [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] grew more and more hesitant."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.ridicule.desc:0 "My constant snide comments about [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] [disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')] really seems to have gotten to [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]! Since the others began to follow my example, [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] has grown more and more hesitant."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.withhold_information.desc:0 "Since I began to withhold information from [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName], [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] has made a damn fool of [disobedient_subject.GetHerselfHimself] on more occasions than I can count. Dismissing [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] hopelessly outdated suggestions has been easier than outwitting a dog."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.impossible_task.desc:0 "When [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] tried to complete [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] tasks thoroughly, I scolded [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] in front of everyone, and when [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] hurried to get done in time, I displayed [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] sloppy work for all to see. [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe|U] bent [disobedient_subject.GetHerselfHimself] backwards to please me, yet I never acknowledged [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] efforts."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.shame.desc:0 "The issue [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] brought up used to make me look bad, but now the tables have turned. Every time [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] has raised a subject of concern I have skillfully shifted the blame back to [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim], or made [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] seem petty for even bringing it up."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.objectification.desc:0 "Lewd jokes, lingering looks, interrupting [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] to "compliment" [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] [disobedient_subject.Custom('ObjectifiedFeature')]. Little by little, I have broken [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] down, rendering [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] tense and self-conscious."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.threat.desc:0 "Sometimes, a simple threat of violence does the trick."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.end.desc:0 "Now [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] remains quiet, eyes cast low."
 diplomacy_generic.0014.a.cruel:0 "[disobedient_subject.GetSheHe|U] will think twice before challenging me again!"
 diplomacy_generic.0014.a.compassionate:0 "Cruel, perhaps, but it had to be done."

 diplomacy_generic.0015.t:1 "$diplomacy_generic.0012.t$: From Puppeteer to Puppet"
 diplomacy_generic.0015.make_invisible.desc:0 "When [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] raised [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] voice to speak, I yawned and turned my attention to my papers. I expected the others to follow my lead, but instead they engaged in the conversation. When I finally swallowed my pride to join in, [disobedient_subject.GetFirstName] already had the upper hand and my words were soon forgotten."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.ridicule.desc:0 "As it turns out, [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] wit is far sharper than I had anticipated. As I commented on [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] [disobedient_subject.Custom('PointOfRidicule')], [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] immediately turned the situation around and made me look petty for answering to a genuine problem with a snide remark."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.impossible_task.desc:0 "To my great surprise, [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] had managed to enlist one of the others to help [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] out with the task I had assigned [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim]. As they barely had time to finish it properly together, it became apparent I had asked for too much. I could not even complain about the execution."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.shame.desc:0 "Shifting the blame to [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] turned out to be harder than I had imagined. Yes, I can be convincing, but it turns out [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] is even more skilled at this game than I. With a single sentence, [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] tore my explanation to shreds, making me look either stupid or untrustworthy. I am not sure which is worse."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.objectification.desc:0 "I had thought my lewd comments would shut [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] up, but [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis] response was worthy, yet pointed. Now the other thinks [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] is some kind of saint, while I seemed both trivial and immoral in comparison."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.threat.desc:0 "I had thought my threats would shut [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] up, but [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] simply ignored it and continued. [disobedient_subject.GetHerHis|U] utter lack of fear made my words seem trivial, rather than intimidating."
 diplomacy_generic.0015.withhold_information.desc:0 "Even though I regularly have "forgotten" to send [disobedient_subject.GetTitledFirstName] messages or invite [disobedient_subject.GetHerHim] to meetings, [disobedient_subject.GetSheHe] always seem to be in the know. Now I look confused and incompetent in comparison!"
 diplomacy_generic.0015.a:0 "You win this time, [disobedient_subject.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
