 # General Agent Events

 agent_events.0001.t: "Thick as Thieves"
 agent_events.0001.desc: "Since recruiting both [char_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [char_2.GetTitledFirstName] to my [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')], the pair've become rather amicable with one another.\n\nIt seems shared tasks and mutual concerns have brought out a little spark of kindred recognition in the two reprobates.\n\nTheir understanding is nothing serious yet, but a little nudge could see true friendship blossom."
 agent_events.0001.a: "Motivation you say..."
 agent_events.0001.b: "Perhaps their rapport could prove fruitful..."
 agent_events.0001.b.tt.success: "Bonds of affection bind tight"
 agent_events.0001.b.tt.failure: "You fail to motivate them further"
 agent_events.0001.c: "Kindly focus on the task at hand."
 agent_events.0001.d: "Good for them."

 agent_events.0011.t: "Close Working Conditions"
 agent_events.0011.desc: "[char_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [char_2.GetTitledFirstName] seem to be enjoying themselves a little bit #EMP too#! much for the humble role they play in my designs.\n\nCommon ground in our little plan to [scheme.GetName] has given way to mutual respect, which in turn is clearly becoming a firm bond.\n\nHowever unlikely the origin may be."
 agent_events.0011.a: "A friendship forged at my favor!"
 agent_events.0011.b: "[char_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] #EMP is#! amusing..."
 agent_events.0011.c: "[char_2.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] could choose better."
 agent_events.0011.d: "Let us three be friends together."
 agent_events.0011.e: "I'm so glad we're all getting along!"
 agent_events.0011.f: "This isn't a social gathering."

 agent_events.0012.t: "Closer Working Conditions"
 agent_events.0012.desc: "[char_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [char_2.GetTitledFirstName] seem to be enjoying themselves a little bit #EMP too#! much for the humble role they play in my designs.\n\nStolen glances, hushed whispers, letters exchanged under pretense — were I more suspicious, I might fail to recognize this as the clear signs of an early relationship waiting to take root.\n\nNot #EMP quite#! the point of a plan to [scheme.GetName]."
 agent_events.0012.a: "And aren't they grateful to me for helping?"
 agent_events.0012.b: "Doubtless, their passions can be harnessed."
 agent_events.0012.c: "Perhaps their passions could be harnessed..."
 agent_events.0012.c.tt.success: "Lovebirds make [scheme.GetNameNoTooltip] a game"
 agent_events.0012.c.tt.failure: "The spark is quenched"
 agent_events.0012.d: "This is not what we're here for!"
 agent_events.0012.e: "Who cares?"
 agent_events.0012.e.tt.become_lovers: "The start of something more"
 agent_events.0012.e.tt.not_lovers: "$agent_events.0012.c.tt.failure$"

 agent_events.0021.t: "Learning from the Best"
 agent_events.0021.desc.intro: "Two of my agents, [char_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [char_2.GetTitledFirstName], seem to have found common cause in our plan beyond the basic goal.\n\nImpressed by [char_2.GetHerHis] compatriot's skill with"
 agent_events.0021.desc.diplomacy: "the letters, speechcraft, and general rhetoric"
 agent_events.0021.desc.martial: "the logistics, will, and leadership presence"
 agent_events.0021.desc.stewardship: "the arithmetic, accounting, and nose for detail"
 agent_events.0021.desc.intrigue: "shrewdness, cunning, and ruthless double-dealing"
 agent_events.0021.desc.learning: "the wisom, reading, and general knowledge"
 agent_events.0021.desc.prowess: "wits, brawn, and physical conditioning"
 agent_events.0021.desc.outro: "required to [scheme.GetName], [char_2.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has taken to studying what [char_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] does differently to [char_2.GetHerselfHimself] in the hopes of improving his own skills.\n\nHarmless enough, in theory, but it doesn't help our overall goal."
 agent_events.0021.a: "Excellent!"
 agent_events.0021.b: "Put that energy into the plan, you fool."
 agent_events.0021.c: "Perhaps there's something I could learn from this..."

 agent_events.0031.t: "Learning on the Job"
 agent_events.0031.desc: "Of those I've chosen to involve in this little [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')], [char_1.GetTitledFirstName] is probably not the absolute #EMP most#! skilled.\n\nStill, [char_1.GetSheHe]'s clearly applying [char_1.GetHerselfHimself], determined not to let my efforts go to waste, with the aim of improving [char_1.GetHerHis] skill in matters of [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeType')|l].\n\nBettering yourself is costly, but helps us all in the end."
 agent_events.0031.a: "You can go further than this!"
 agent_events.0031.a.tt.success: "Pushed to the limit"
 agent_events.0031.a.tt.failure: "Strain to no effect"
 agent_events.0031.b: "Credit goes, naturally, to our mastermind."
 agent_events.0031.c: "The plan goes well..."

 agent_events.0041.t: "Studious Scheming"
 agent_events.0041.desc: "[char_1.GetTitledFirstName] is certainly an asset to my [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')], providing skill, wisdom, and guidance as best [char_1.GetSheHe] can at every turn.\n\nMost recently, that's meant offering to help tutor #EMP me#!, in an effort to improve our overall chances.\n\nThe offer is... #EMP tempting#!, if presumptious."
 agent_events.0041.a: "I accept."
 agent_events.0041.a.tt.success: "You learn a thing or two"
 agent_events.0041.a.tt.failure: "A waste of time"
 agent_events.0041.a.tt.they_attempt_to_teach_you: "[char_1.GetFirstName] will attempt to use [char_1.GetHerHis] [skill|E] to teach you #WEAK (this is easier the better than you [char_1.GetSheHe] is)#!"
 agent_events.0041.b: "How quaint! No."
 agent_events.0041.c: "Put your mind to the task, not to me."

 agent_events.1001.t: "At the Wrong Throat"
 agent_events.1001.desc: "I've rarely heard two people argue as much as [char_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [char_2.GetTitledFirstName], two #EMP nominal#! allies in our [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')]. Something about the other just seems, unfortunately, to rub them each the wrong way.\n\nAt first, I tried to leave well enough alone, relying on them to sort themselves out, but it's clear that if they're not stopped then it will cost the rest of us."
 agent_events.1001.a: "Lecture them both."
 agent_events.1001.a.tt.success: "They take your words to heart"
 agent_events.1001.a.tt.failure: "Your arguments fall on deaf ears"
 agent_events.1001.b: "Appeal to reason."
 agent_events.1001.b.tt.success: "$agent_events.1001.a.tt.success$"
 agent_events.1001.b.tt.failure: "$agent_events.1001.a.tt.failure$"
 agent_events.1001.c: "Hatred isn't such a problematic tool..."
 agent_events.1001.d: "You. Will. Stop."
 agent_events.1001.e: "Let the sods bicker."
 agent_events.1001.e.rivals_bicker: "Incessant arguing"
 agent_events.1001.e.rivals_bicker_less: "Occasional arguing"

 agent_events.1011.t: "Wounds Fester"
 agent_events.1011.desc: "Perhaps it was foolish of me to choose two people who seem to #EMP hate#! each other to act as my aids in this [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] — certainly the constant arguments and petty spite from [char_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [char_2.GetTitledFirstName] seem determined to prove it so.\n\nStill, no matter their loathing they should be able to focus on the job at hand."
 agent_events.1011.a: "Force them to work together."
 agent_events.1011.b: "Try to keep them apart."
 agent_events.1011.c: "Leave well enough alone."

 agent_events.2001.t: "A Pleasure to Work With"
 agent_events.2001.desc: "It's truly fortunate that I'm afforded a chance to plan this [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] with [relation.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] by my side.\n\nA better, more observant aide no [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan] could ask for, always willing to go the extra mile for our needs, always focused on how best to advance the [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')].\n\nMost recently, [relation.GetHerHis] work has resulted in a shortcut that should save us a significant amount of time."
 agent_events.2001.a: "Excellent news!"

 agent_events.2011.t: "Personal Agendas"
 agent_events.2011.desc: "What madness possessed me to bring [relation.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] into my [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')]?\n\nThe foolish oaf has been nothing but trouble from the very first day I involved [relation.GetHerHim], a maddening, ugly little thorn in my side.\n\nNever openly sabotaging me, of course, but when anything and everything you touch goes wrong for seemingly no reason, and someone's always got a smile about it..."
 agent_events.2011.a: "That conniving little [relation.Custom('InsultNoun')]!"

 agent_events.2021.t: "A Little Competition"
 agent_events.2021.desc: "It seems our [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] has become something of a game for [agent_1.GetTitledFirstName] and [agent_2.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nThough not previously especially close or argumentative, the two are enjoying a leisurely feud over who can excel at their tasks best, with each trying constantly to show up the other.\n\nIt's just a small thing for now, but it has the seeds of something fiercer in it."
 agent_events.2021.a: "A little friendly competition is good!"
 agent_events.2021.b: "A serious rivalry could have its benefits..."
 agent_events.2021.c: "Leave them be."

 agent_events.3001.t: "Burning at Both Ends"
 agent_events.3001.desc: "It's clear that [relation.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] is sincerely putting [relation.GetHerHis] all into my [scheme.GetName] [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')], dedicating sleepless nights and long days to our goals\n\nPerhaps... perhaps it is cruel of me to use one who is dear to me so? Certainly I cannot say I would like to be used so.\n\nStill, [relation.GetSheHe] #EMP is#! effective, and it's for a good cause."
 agent_events.3001.a: "Please, give it your #EMP all#!."
 agent_events.3001.b: "You could do more, so much more!"
 agent_events.3001.c: "Spend a little time with me instead, [relation.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 agent_events.3001.d: "Rest awhile, [relation.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], you've done enough."

 agent_events.3011.t: "For My Sake"
 agent_events.3011.desc: ""#EMP Please#!, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. You work too much, it's like this [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] is consuming you!" moans [relation.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], for what feels like the hundredth time.\n\nI #EMP have#! been diligent of late, there's no denying that, but no more than necessary, surely.\n\nThe haggard look of worry [relation.Custom('MaskFace_BehindAcross')] [relation.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] [relation.Custom('MaskFace')] tells me that that may not be the case."
 agent_events.3011.a: "For you? Of course!"
 agent_events.3011.b: "A #EMP true#! [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort',SCOPE.sC('relation'))] wouldn't ask this of me."
 agent_events.3011.c: "The only way out is through, [relation.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]..."

 agent_events.3021.t: "The Family that Stays Together"
 agent_events.3021.desc: "It's a little odd, for [relation.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] and I to be brought together so over this [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] to [scheme.GetName].\n\nStill, there's joy to be found in a common task, in working together towards a goal. Frustrations shared are lessened, triumphs multiplied, and there's always something to talk about.\n\nI am glad to have brought [relation.GetHerHim] in on this endeavor."
 agent_events.3021.a: "Familial bliss..."

 agent_events.3031.t: "Torn Apart"
 agent_events.3031.desc: ""By [relation.GetFaith.HealthGodName], are you even my [relation.Custom2('RelationToMeShort',ROOT.Char)] anymore? The very sight of you enrages me these days!" snaps [relation.GetFirstName].\n\nThis argument is fairly typical of our interactions of late, disagreements over plans and practices abounding, turns of phrase taken in the worst way, and the slightest of disputes becoming hours-long arguments.\n\nWhatever common ground I'd hoped to build by involving [relation.GetHerHim] with this [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] seems utterly ruined."
 agent_events.3031.a: "Please, [relation.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], it's not like that."
 agent_events.3031.a.tt.success: "Your pleading is suitably pitiful"
 agent_events.3031.a.tt.failure: "Your words fall on deaf ears"
 agent_events.3031.b: "You just don't understand my vision!"

 agent_events.3041.t: "Second Thoughts"
 agent_events.3041.desc: ""[target.GetSheHe|U]'s my [target_relation.Custom2('RelationToMeShort',SCOPE.sC('target'))], damn it!" cries [target_relation.GetFirstName], beside [target_relation.GetHerselfHimself] with frustration and worry at being involved with my little [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')].\n\nOf course, given we're plotting [scheme.GetName] against [target.GetFirstName], that's perhaps understandable.\n\n"Maybe I could... withdraw, just a little. I'm no good to you in this state anyway"."
 agent_events.3041.tt.forced_to_stay: "[relation.GetFirstName] will be forced to stay in the [scheme.GetName] [scheme|E]"
 agent_events.3041.a: "Kindly #EMP remember#! why you are here."
 agent_events.3041.a.tt.forced_to_stay_longer: "$agent_events.3041.tt.forced_to_stay$ even longer"
 agent_events.3041.b: "Allow me to change your mind..."
 agent_events.3041.b.tt.success: "[relation.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will stay"
 agent_events.3041.b.tt.failure: "[relation.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is free to leave"
 agent_events.3041.c: "You well know that you cannot go."
 agent_events.3041.c.tt.success: "$agent_events.3041.b.tt.success$"
 agent_events.3041.c.tt.failure: "$agent_events.3041.b.tt.failure$"
 agent_events.3041.d: "You can leave at any time."

 agent_events.3051.t: "A Common Enemy"
 agent_events.3051.desc: "It's clear from our most recent discussions that [target_rival.GetFirstName] is warming up to me, largely from respect for how I'm handling the [scheme.GetName] [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] against [target_rival.GetHerHis] hated foe, [target.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nAn odd way to find common ground with someone, but certainly a fervently earnest one.\n\nSo earnest, in fact, that [target_rival.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] seems determined to pay back my efforts against [target_rival.GetHerHis] rival, even preemptively!"
 agent_events.3051.a: "A favor for a favor."
 agent_events.3051.b: "Perhaps we could be friends?"
 agent_events.3051.c: "Spend your time on our plans, please."

 agent_events.3061.t: "Saving Grace"
 agent_events.3061.desc: "One of the key advantages of having [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] spymaster [target_spymaster.GetFirstName] involved in our [scheme.GetName] [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')] is that the person most likely to discover us is working ably to keep us a secret.\n\nThough always helpful maintaining this cloak of silence around our efforts, [target_spymaster.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has been #EMP particularly#! adept of late, buying us several months of sure, uninterrupted silence."
 agent_events.3061.a: "A pleasant surprise!"
 agent_events.3061.a.tt.extra_grace: "Your [scheme.GetName] [scheme|E] receives several months of additional [secrecy_grace|E]"

 agent_events.3071.t: "If I May Suggest"
 agent_events.3071.desc.intro.nemesis: "[agent.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive|U] deep hatred of [target.GetTitledFirstName] motivates some #EMP truly#! astounding creativity when given the opportunity to express itself."
 agent_events.3071.desc.intro.spymaster: "As [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] spymaster, [agent.GetTitledFirstName] has many opportunities to find unique ways to augment our little [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')]."
 agent_events.3071.desc.intro.councillor: "Being one of [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] trusted councillors, [agent.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] skills and vision serve our cause well."
 agent_events.3071.desc.outro: "\n\nToday, this manifests as a range of possible agents we could work into the endeavour. More than one risks destabilizing our efforts, but any single one could still be a powerful augmentation."
 agent_events.3071.a: "Something to better our potential odds you say..."
 agent_events.3071.b: "A way to speed our plans along?"
 agent_events.3071.c: "Helping us stay secret intrigues me."
 agent_events.3071.d: "My plan is already flawless, thank you."

 agent_events.4001.t: "Too Far Afield"
 agent_events.4001.desc: "No matter what [distant_agent.GetHerHis] other worth may be to our [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')], there's no denying that [distant_agent.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] sheer distance from [scheme.GetTargetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] causes us... issues.\n\nA remote agent simply cannot be as helpful as one able to move around as needed.\n\nAlas, we pay the price for this now."
 agent_events.4001.a: "You're a liability, [distant_agent.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], be gone!"
 agent_events.4001.b: "Damnation..."

 agent_events.4011.t: "A Shadow At Court"
 agent_events.4011.desc: "Truly it is a blessing to have someone like [skilled_agent.GetTitledFirstName] involved in our [scheme.Custom('GetSchemeContract')], someone able to advance our goals in any number of ways, simply waiting for direction.\n\nAn enviable combination of skill, access, and proximity to [scheme.GetTargetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] provides us with a variety of options on how to exploit [skilled_agent.GetHerHim]."
 agent_events.4011.a: "Subtle gains are always best."
 agent_events.4011.b: "Future potential seems helpful..."
 agent_events.4011.c: "Covertness is key!"
 agent_events.4011.d: "This opens some doors for us."
