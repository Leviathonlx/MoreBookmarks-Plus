 befriend_ongoing_rival.0001.desc:0 "I carefully weighed each word as I wrote the letter to [target.GetTitledFirstName].

 befriend_ongoing_rival.0004.desc:0 "I desperately tried to explain my opinion in a way which would make sense from [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] point of view, but I only ended up entangling myself in my own arguments. \n\nThis gave [target.GetHerHim] plenty of angles to attack me from, and I came out of the argument looking like a damned fool."
