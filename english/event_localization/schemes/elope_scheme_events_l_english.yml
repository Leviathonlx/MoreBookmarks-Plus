 ##I am a player, do I want to take the risk?
 elope_event_title:0 "Elope:"
 elope.0001.t:0 "$elope_event_title$ Protected by Shadows"
 elope.0001.positive.desc:0 "The final preparations are in place. The escape route has been charted, the guards bribed and [target.GetTitledFirstName] is ready. Tonight, as darkness falls over [location.GetNameNoTooltip], I shall set my [target.Custom('LoverPetName')] free and make [target.GetHerHim] my [target.GetWifeHusband]."
 elope.0001.negative.desc:0 "I go through the list in my head. The escape route has been charted, the guards should have received their bribes and hopefully the note I sent to [target.GetTitledFirstName] reached [target.GetHerHim] in time. But what if it did not? Maybe [target.GetSheHe] hasn't received it at all! And there are so many other things that might have gone wrong...\n\nThere is no time for doubt. This is my only chance. I must go to [target.GetHerHim], come what may, or abandon the endeavor."
 elope.0001.a:0 "I am coming for you, [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 elope.0001.b:0 "What am I doing? This is madness!"

 elope.1001.start.desc:0 "As we wait, I cannot help but imagine everything that might go wrong. I feel utterly powerless — a feeling that I #EMP don't#! care to get further acquainted with.\n\nI spot a torch ahead, moving in our direction, and gesture to my guards to hide."
 elope.1001.start.desc_brave:0 "As we wait, I cannot help but wonder where [target.GetFirstName] is now. Did [target.GetSheHe] make it out okay? Will there be pursuers?\n\nI spot a torch ahead, moving in our direction, and gesture to my guards to hide."
 elope.1001.end.desc:0 "The light moves closer and we can make out two silhouettes. One is carrying a sword, that much is clear. The other... it must be #EMP [target.GetHerHim]#!!\n\nI run to meet my [target.Custom('LoverPetName')], and [target.GetSheHe] throw [target.GetHerselfHimself] in my open arms. The embrace is swift, but sweet as honey. With [target.GetHerHis] hand in mine, I begin to run."
 elope.1001.a:0 "Hurry, my love! The [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] is waiting!"

 elope.1002.apologetic_relationship.desc:0 ""My dearest [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], I am so very sorry, but I have to follow my heart. I have left you to marry the love of my life — [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)].""
 elope.1002.unapologetic_relationship.desc:0 ""I have left to marry [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)]. Do not come after me — I would rather die than be yours again!""

 elope.1002.unapologetic_family.desc:0 ""If you truly loved your own [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort' , target)], you would have wanted me to be happy.
