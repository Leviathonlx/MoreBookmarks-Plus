 claim_throne_outcome.1001.b:0 "Perhaps I am being too rash..."

 claim_throne_outcome.2001.opening:0 "Finally, no one can doubt the fact that I have a reasonable claim on the [target_title.GetName]!"
 claim_throne_outcome.2001.discovered:0 "\n\nWhile [target.GetTitledFirstName] believes my claim of old dynastic marriage is entirely fabricated, the important matter is that [target.GetSheHe] cannot disprove it."
 claim_throne_outcome.2001.no_awareness:0 "\n\nWhile the exact details of the old dynastic marriage are shrouded in the mists of time, there is no reason to doubt its veracity. Even [target.GetTitledFirstName] must admit my claim is a legitimate one."

 claim_throne_outcome.4001.owner_secret:0 "\n\nAlthough the marriage records between the dynasty of [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] and the old ruling dynasty of [target_title.GetNameNoTierNoTooltip] have been dismissed as inaccurate, at least no one has discovered that I was the one who had them created."

 claim_throne_outcome.2002.discovered:0 "\n\nWhile [target.GetTitledFirstName] believes the tracing of my lineage to [ROOT.Char.Custom('ClaimThroneMythicalFounder')] is entirely spurious, [target.GetSheHe] has been unable to disprove it, and that is all that matters."

 claim_throne_outcome.4002.owner_discovered:1 "\n\nIt was far easier than I expected for [target.GetTitledFirstName] to disprove that I have any relation to that ancient ruler, [owner.Custom('ClaimThroneMythicalFounder')].

 claim_throne_outcome.4002.owner_secret:1 "\n\nNo one believes that I could be descended from that ancient ruler, [owner.Custom('ClaimThroneMythicalFounder')], but at least [target.GetTitledFirstName] seems unaware that all my "evidence" was entirely fabricated in the first place."

 claim_throne_outcome.2003.discovered:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstName] has publicly condemned the promise made to me by the old [previous_holder.GetTitledFirstName] as desperate lies, but it is [target.GetHerHis] word against the sacred oaths speaking in my favor."

Instead, they now claim that I bribed them to do it! While true, it is an absolutely despicable breach of loyalty."
 claim_throne_outcome.4003.owner_secret:0 "\n\nUnder pressure from [target.GetTitledFirstName], all those who swore that the old [previous_holder.GetTitledFirstName] had promised to make me [previous_holder.GetHerHis] heir backed away from their claims.
