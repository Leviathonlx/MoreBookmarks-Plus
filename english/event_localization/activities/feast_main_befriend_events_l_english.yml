[glutton_target.GetSheHe|U] greedily tore pieces from meat, juices running down [glutton_target.GetHerHis] cheek, as the insatiable hunger I know all too well started rumbling in my stomach while I kept passing food to [glutton_target.GetHerHim]."
 feast_main_befriend.2003.cannibal_kindness:1 "\n\nFrom my new seat I watched barons and $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$ stuff ever more into their gaping maws, and as the hunger rose within me I offered to wipe the fat off someone's chin, just so I could touch that soft, plump neck..."
 feast_main_befriend.2003.kind_to_lower_nobility:1 "\n\nI looked to the lords, ladies and $knight_culture_player_plural_no_tooltip_lowercase$ without scorn.
