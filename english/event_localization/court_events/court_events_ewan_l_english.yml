 # PATRONAGE
 court.2001.t:0 "Competitive Cronying"
 court.2001.desc:0 "Neither [crony_a.GetFirstName] nor [crony_b.GetFirstName] notice as I creep closer to their boisterous hallway conversation.\n\n"#EMP Physical#! supplication is key! Every groveling-induced bruise on my knee is fresh coin in my purse! You just can't go wrong with prostration."\n\n"Nonsense, just keep stacking adjectives in front of [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] title and you'll be rich till you die. If you've got air in your lungs before you get to '[ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]', you're doing it wrong."\n\nI cough, hushing the mortified toadies instantly."
 court.2001.a:0 "Honestly, you could both try harder at this."
 court.2001.a.sadistic:0 "Whoever bows lowest gets this #EMP shiny#! coin. Go."
 court.2001.a.sadistic.crony_a_wins:0 "[crony_a.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] bows lowest"
 court.2001.a.sadistic.crony_b_wins:0 "[crony_b.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] bows lowest"
 court.2001.b:0 "I see right through your manipulations, lackeys!"
 court.2001.c:0 "I think you're missing the most obvious way to my heart..."
 court.2001.d:0 "This is beneath me."

 # MAJESTY
 court.2201.t:0 "A Slice of the Pie"
 court.2201.desc:0 ""-belongs to me! Dividing [ROOT.Char.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier] up between separate heirs makes no sense!" cries [eldest_heir.GetFirstName] as [eldest_heir.GetSheHe] and [younger_heir.Custom2('HerHisCharacterIntroduction', eldest_heir)] bicker loudly at the other end of the room. "We're dooming the realm to murder and civil war. [ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather|U] should leave all [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] lands to #EMP me#!!"\n\n"Murder? Civil war? Exactly #EMP what#! do you have planned for when you're [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]?" snorts [younger_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. "You'll be an utter monster of a ruler if this is how you think about your own family before the crown has even #EMP touched#! your ugly skull."\n\nMy head throbs. They've been arguing. All. Morning."
 court.2201.a:0 "Entitled to #EMP more#!, [eldest_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]? How about #EMP nothing#!!"
 court.2201.b:0 "Sad to say, those are just the rules of the game, [younger_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]..."
 court.2201.c:0 "They're family, they'll get along #EMP fine#! without me, right?"
 court.2201.d:0 "Children, do you want to know the real meaning of family?"

 # FOREIGN GUESTS
 court.2401.t:0 "Second-Hand Glamor"
 court.2401.desc:1 ""Finest raiments in the land, good [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], mostly because they #EMP ain't#! from this land", chortles [seller.GetFirstName] as I walk past [seller.GetHerHis] open chamber. [seller.GetHerHis|U] voice oozes charm and slickness.\n\n"Almost new, just as good as new, and fresh from the trend-setters in [grander_ruler.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] court! These are what #EMP everyone#! in the [grander_ruler.GetPrimaryTitle.GetName] will be wearing next season.""
 court.2401.a:0 "My, those #EMP do#! look enticing..."
 court.2401.b:0 "We don't need foreign nonsense in my court!"
 court.2401.c:0 "Who cares what people wear?"

 court.2411.t:0 "Labyrinthine Halls"
 court.2411.desc:1 "My stroll takes me through a disused wing of the palace, touring some capacious (if dusty) quarters that my over-worked staff seldom visit, when I hear a phlegmy sobbing coming from a by-passage.\n\nInvestigating, I find [lost_guest.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], collapsed in despair. [lost_guest.GetSheHe|U] surges up the second [lost_guest.GetSheHe] sees me, grabbing me by the shoulders, and starts babbling like a mad[lost_guest.GetWomanMan].\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I've been lost in these passages for #EMP three days#!! I can't find the way out, just endless loops of connecting corridors and mouldering chambers with nary a servant in sight!""
 court.2411.a:1 "By [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], let me show you the way out!"
 court.2411.b:0 "How in the... How #EMP foolish#! can you possibly be?"
 court.2411.c:1 "*Whistling* What a honeycomb of halls I keep..."
