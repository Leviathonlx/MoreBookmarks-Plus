 court.3010.desc.low_learning:0 "Every description of the protagonist mentions him having 'big, beautiful azure orbs,' and [inspired_writer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] brings that to focus even in inappropriate situations."
 court.3010.desc.shy_or_chaste:0 "My eyes land on the description of an evening scene. Two lovers tenderly loop their pinky fingers as they are too bashful to hold hands. They whisper sweet nothings as they walk underneath a sea of endless stars."
 court.3010.desc.lustful:0 "Every sentence describing a woman is excruciatingly descriptive and always features words like bouncing or jiggling. But it's not just the women, but the men too. However, their descriptions focus on their bulging muscles and chiseled chins."
 court.3010.desc.adventurer_or_pilgrim:0 "The focus is on vast, scenic landscapes and how it changes with the increased distance from home. There's some passages about wanderlust and homesickness as well, clearly the experiences of the writer."
 court.3010.desc.sadistic:0 "The violence described exceeds most people's tolerance for gore and obscenities. It paints a bloody scene red, with knights wading in blood up to their knees."
 court.3010.desc.generic_fallback:1 "The setting is familiar, as is the protagonist's name. Wait. Could this be [inspired_writer.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] attempt at writing a continuation or rewrite of another person's work?"
