Over and over again.\n\nI am shaking by the time I return to dry land, where I am greeted by subordinate [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural]. I have sworn my protection to not only the water that has flowed through my hands today, but to the entire river, and through it, the eternity of existence."
 south_asia.0011.a:0 "None can doubt my dedication to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."

 south_asia.0012.desc:0 "With control over the entire course of the Ganges, [ruler_of_ganges.GetTitledFirstName] has claimed spiritual guardianship of its sacred waters.

 south_asia.0030.desc:0 "Though we are one of the last bastions of Theravada teachings, our nobles continue to embrace the faith enthusiastically. The common folk, however, retain fierce pride in their traditional ways, and worship of their malevolent Nat deities remains widespread.\n\nA prudent ruler might find it wise to compromise when dealing with matters such as these, but perhaps a sterner approach is necessary..."

 south_asia.0031.desc:0 "It's one thing to be cultural interlopers; it's quite another to assert religious hegemony. The common folk are angry, and there's no shortage of derisive mutters at the mention of your name amongst the more traditional types at court, [ari_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] among them.\n\nMy hand could yet be open as a peacemaker, or curled as the fist of an unforgiving ruler. Or, further still, I could withdraw it entirely and let the flame burn itself out in time. I must choose wisely..."

 south_asia.0032.desc:0 "The traditional Burmese folk deities still remain entrenched, particularly in the rural areas. Removing the peoples' right to worship as they wish would do more harm than good, and so the introduction of a thirty-seventh deity — Thagyamin, the Buddhist protector God — into the pantheon as the first and foremost of them was received wholly amicably.\n\nA golden opportunity now stands before you. The traditional heartlands of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] Buddhism lie in Lanka, but it is constantly threatened by powers on the mainland. Alternatively, it could be time for us to decide the path of our newly-strengthened faith."

Their influence could be undermined, yet cannot be underestimated.\n\nThese wine-drinking, animal sacrificing religious leaders must be dealt with, but dealt with delicately lest their persecution is seen as a threat to the still-vulnerable peace in the region."

 south_asia.0039.desc:0 "The evangelizing work of [proselytiser.GetFullName] appears to have gone poorly. [proselytiser.GetHerHis|U] heavy-handed approach to spreading the Theravada faith has resulted in uproar and protests, which have subsequently been brutally crushed.\n\nAny lord or lady who dared protect an adherent of the embattled Ari faith has either vanished or now insists that they were misquoted, and none dare challenge the patience of their zealous liege.\n\nWhether there are further ramifications for those who were known to be on the side of the oppressed remains to be seen..."
