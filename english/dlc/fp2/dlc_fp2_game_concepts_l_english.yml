 game_concept_struggle_desc:2 "$game_concept_struggle_struggles$ are long-term conflicts involving large [struggle_region_regions|E] with many [faiths|E] and [cultures|E]. Within the boundaries of a $game_concept_struggle$, peculiar special rules and [modifiers|E] may take effect, changing over time. Since they last decades to centuries, not all [characters|E] in a $game_concept_struggle$ are at [war|E] with each other all of the time.\n\nEach $game_concept_struggle$ consists of multiple [struggle_phase_phases|E]. As $game_concept_characters$ within the [struggle_region|E] act (e.g., declaring $game_concept_war$, or [marrying|E]), they may activate [struggle_catalyst_catalysts|E] that progress them between the different $game_concept_struggle_phase_phases$.\n\nDepending on the degree to which they're seen to be a part of the $game_concept_struggle$ by other participants, $game_concept_characters$ with [land|E] in the area may be seen as [struggle_involved|E], [struggle_interloper_interlopers|E], or [struggle_uninvolved|E]."

 game_concept_iberian_struggle:1 "Iberian Struggle"
 game_concept_iberian_struggle_desc:2 "The $game_concept_iberian_struggle$ depicts the centuries of fractious relationships on the Iberian Peninsula. Though born of the Umayyad Conquest of Iberia in the 8th Century, the [struggle|E] shifts between [struggle_phase_phases|E] of hate-fueled violence, wary truces, and pragmatic cooperation. There are few permanent allies in such a situation, and [rulers|E] should be wary of relying purely on a shared [faith|E] or [culture|E]."
 game_concept_struggle_phase:1 "Struggle Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_phase:1 "Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_phases:0 "Phases"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_desc:1 "A $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$ is a general mood common to [struggle_involved|E] [characters|E] and [counties|E] within a [struggle_region|E]. It represents short-term societal trends and mores temporarily dominating the dialogue of the [struggle|E].\n\n#weak Example: in one $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, the people of a $game_concept_struggle_region_region$ may think that religious tolerance is paramount even if the rest of their faith disagrees.#!"

 game_concept_struggle_catalyst_desc:2 "[struggle_struggles|E] transition between [struggle_phase_phases|E] when certain notable actions are taken, building their [struggle_region|E]'s consensus towards a particular mood. A list of which actions are important in which $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$ can be found in the $game_concept_struggle$ window.\n\n#weak Example: the [struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity|E] of the [iberian_struggle|E] can transition into either the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E] or the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E]. Murdering an important [character|E] might work towards the former, whilst forming a [marriage|E] [alliance|E] with someone of a different [faith|E] would build towards the latter."

 game_concept_struggle_involved:1 "Involved"
 game_concept_struggle_involved_desc:2 "When a [character|E] or a [county|E] is $game_concept_struggle_involved$, it means they're considered a natural and integral part of a [struggle|E] by the people of a particular [struggle_region|E]. They benefit fully from the fluid advantages of [struggle_phase_phases|E], and are the primary activators of [struggle_catalyst_catalysts|E].\n\n[cultures|E] and [faiths|E] that are considered $game_concept_struggle_involved$ are those that have or had significant presence in the $game_concept_struggle_region_region$.\n\n#weak To be $game_concept_struggle_involved$, a $game_concept_character$ must have both their $game_concept_culture$ and $game_concept_faith$ be $game_concept_struggle_involved$ #EMP and#! have their [capital|E] within the $game_concept_struggle_region$.#!"

 game_concept_struggle_interloper:1 "Interloper"
 game_concept_struggle_interloper_interlopers:0 "Interlopers"
 game_concept_struggle_interloper_desc:2 "When a [character|E] is tangled up in a specific [struggle|E] but not yet considered fully [struggle_involved|E], they're an $game_concept_struggle_interloper$.\n\n$game_concept_struggle_interloper_interlopers$ have their [capital|E]s within the [struggle_region|E], but do not have both an $game_concept_struggle_involved$ [faith|E] and an $game_concept_struggle_involved$ [culture|E].\n\nFully $game_concept_struggle_involved$ $game_concept_characters$ think of them as nosy, troublesome outlanders who don't understand where they're not wanted. $game_concept_struggle_interloper$ [rulers|E] thus generally take some penalties in [counties|E] they hold inside a $game_concept_struggle_region$."

 game_concept_struggle_uninvolved:1 "Uninvolved"
 game_concept_struggle_uninvolved_desc:2 "For a [character|E] to be considered $game_concept_struggle_uninvolved$ in a particular [struggle|E], they need only have their [capital|E] outside the [struggle_region|E].\n\nThis means they're considered an outsider, someone who not only doesn't have a serious stake in the ongoing [struggle_phase_phases|E], but who #EMP shouldn't#!, because they clearly couldn't understand the local nuances.\n\nAs one of the only things people inside a $game_concept_struggle$ can agree on is that $game_concept_struggle_uninvolved$ $game_concept_characters$ have no business in #EMP their#! lands, $game_concept_struggle_uninvolved$ [rulers|E] generally take harsh penalties in any [counties|E] they hold within a $game_concept_struggle_region$."

 game_concept_struggle_large_conquest:1 "Struggle Large Conquest"
 game_concept_struggle_large_conquest_desc:1 "Some $game_concept_struggle_catalyst_catalysts$ involve the successful completion of a major [war|E] by the attacker.\n\nThe following [casus_bellis|E] are counted for this:\n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $duchy_conquest_cb$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $individual_duchy_de_jure_cb$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $imperial_reconquest_cb$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $invasion_war$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $clan_invasion_war$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $mongol_invasion_war$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $major_religious_war$ $game_concept_war$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ Both [great_holy_war_directed|E] & [great_holy_war_undirected|E] $game_concept_great_holy_wars$ \n$EFFECT_LIST_BULLET$ $tribal_subjugation_cb$"

 game_concept_struggle_region_desc:2 "Each [struggle|E] is tied to a [region|E] on the map. A [character_possessive|E] location within this $game_concept_region$ (as well as their [culture|E] and [faith|E]) determines whether they are classified as [struggle_involved|E], an [struggle_interloper|E], or [struggle_uninvolved|E].\n\n[counties|E] within a $game_concept_struggle_region$ are generally subject to different [county_modifiers|E] depending on the current [struggle_phase_phase]."

 game_concept_struggle_conquest:1 "Struggle Clash"
 game_concept_struggle_conquest_conquest:1 "Clash"
 game_concept_struggle_conquest_conquests:0 "Clashes"
 game_concept_struggle_conquest_desc:2 "It's not uncommon for [rulers|E] involved in a [struggle|E] to get into border disputes and petty quarrels, changing with the nature of the current [struggle_phase|E]. The ready availability of niche local disputes allows $game_concept_rulers$ to conduct small-scale land grabs, conquering or vassalizing their targets.\n\nSince $game_concept_struggle_conquest_conquests$ depend on the environment of their $game_concept_struggle$, their [prestige|E] cost scales with the current $game_concept_struggle_phase$."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity:1 "Opportunity Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity_desc:2 "After a long period of relatively peaceful coexistence during the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E], complacency begins to set in. Peasantry and nobility alike are comfortable that things just #EMP work#!, allowing more shrewd [characters|E] to take advantage of their naivety.\n\nEventually, fresh abuses will either cause an escalation into the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E], or else savvy politicking reaches an uneasy equilibrium through the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_hostility:1 "Hostility Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_hostility_desc:2 "Tensions flare and tempers fray in this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$. Repeated acts of malice and escalated misunderstandings during the [struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity|E] have lead to rising hatred of [characters|E] with differing [cultures|E], [faiths|E], or #EMP worse#!: both.\n\nSuch bloodshed cannot persist forever, though. Eventually, either cooler heads or simple exhaustion bring the peninsula to the [struggle_phase_iberia_compromise|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_compromise:1 "Compromise Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_compromise_desc:2 "Whether through sickness with the strife of the [struggle_phase_iberia_hostility|E] or deft escalation during the [struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation|E], the $game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_compromise$ represents a growing accommodation between the peoples of Iberia. Differences fall by the wayside and shared history and heritage binds former foes together.\n\nThe peninsula stands at a cross-roads: if conflicts reappear, then the [struggle_phase_iberia_opportunity|E] awaits."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation:1 "Conciliation Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_iberia_conciliation_desc:1 "The product of a notable [struggle_phase_iberia_compromise|E], during this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, relations between the peoples of Iberia grow so cordial that outsiders find their permissiveness difficult to parse. Inter-[faith|E] [marriages|E] are particularly common.\n\nThis can't last forever, though, and abuses of trust will eventually bring the [iberian_struggle|E] back around to the [struggle_phase_iberia_compromise|E]."
