 ep3_laamps_provisions.1010.desc: "This morning, another bunch of soldiers went missing.\n\nThis trend has been ongoing for several days, and I must accept that they are not simply getting lost while on patrol, or attacked by wild animals while standing on guard. They are deserting.\n\nI admit that things have been rough: food and water are running low, and pay day may come much later than expected. Still, I can't condone such cowardice!"

 ep3_laamps_provisions.1030.desc: "Some of my soldiers are still deserting; most of them, however, don't even have the strength to leave.\n\nDay after day, the numbers of my followers dwindle, as hunger, thirst, and an assortment of sicknesses cut them down one by one."
