#HORSE RACES
 jason_race_events.1.t:0 "The Will of the Crowd"
 jason_race_events.1.desc:0 "From the vast sea of race-watchers, commoners holler out. Itinerant warriors chant insults, vulgar innuendo. Amidst them, we nobles chuckle nervously. We look to our guards."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.guest_local_anger:0 "\n\n"[host.GetTitledFirstName]!" is howled, along with terms like “#EMP [host.Custom('GetCrime')|U]!#!” Those raging loudest are the locals: in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], [host.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is amidst a people who despise [host.GetHerHim].\n\nGazing across the crowd, I see stones, knives, and the weapons of war."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.host_local_anger:0 "\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName]!" is howled, along with terms like “#EMP [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetCrime')|U]!#!” Those raging loudest are all locals — in [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], I am amidst a people who despise me.\n\nGazing across the crowd, I see stones, knives, and the weapons of war."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.rowdy_fans:0 "\n\nThe thrill of the race always draws the worst of the realm, in enormous numbers, and riles them with promises of carousing and gambling. \n\nSometimes, on ill-fated days, the usual pleasures just aren't enough: only blood can satisfy."

 jason_race_events.1.desc.end:0 "\n\nThis is about to be a riot."

 jason_race_events.1.a:0 "Only I can pacify the crowd."
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt:0 "With just the right cajoling words, I'll get their attention back to the race."
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt.win:0 "Your speech calms the people"
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt.race:1 "The Contest continues uninterrupted"
 jason_race_events.1.a.tt.lose:0 "You fail to prevent the riot"

 jason_race_events.1.b:0 "Beat the courage from them, $knights$!"
 jason_race_events.1.b.tt:0 "And once we've wiped the blood from our eyes, we can resume the race!"

 jason_race_events.1.c:0 "Perhaps the mob could use a little push..."
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt:0 "Go, my $knights$ — start some truly devastating violence!"
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt.win:0 "Your $knights$ quell the mob"
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt.lose:0 "Your enforcers set off a terrible riot"
 jason_race_events.1.c.tt.lose_knights:0 "Some of your $knight_culture_player_plural$ are [GetTrait('wounded_1').GetName( GetNullCharacter )]"

 jason_race_events.1.d:0 "I need to get out of here, #EMP fast#!."
 jason_race_events.1.d.tt:0 "Who knows? Maybe everything will turn out alright."

 jason_race_events.1.d.tt.win:0 "The unrest is contained"
 jason_race_events.1.d.tt.lose:0 "Mob violence spills across the land"

 jason_race_events.1.d.tt.leave:0 "You and your entourage withdraw to safety."

 jason_race_events.2.t:0 "A Turn at Speed"
 jason_race_events.2.desc:1 "The horses thunder along the track, their coursing bodies obscured by clouds of dust, the cursing and yelling of their jockeys inaudible amidst hoof-beats and the roar of the crowd.\n\nStill, you can tell your rider [jockey.GetFirstName] is utterly focused on a rapidly-approaching turn. As the others slow to take the sharp bend in stride, your rider spurs hard.\n\nWith just a fingers-breadth to spare, [jockey.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and #EMP [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetContestHorseRaceName')]#! slip between those ahead. An incredible maneuver — the crowd gasps as one!"

 jason_race_events.2.a:0 "Such skills belong on the battlefield!"
 jason_race_events.2.a.tt:0 "My cavalrymen should be trained to ride with similar boldness."

 jason_race_events.2.b:1 "My entourage could use a new scout..."
 jason_race_events.2.b.tt:1 "Such a daring rider should be ahead of us on every journey."

 jason_race_events.2.c:1 "A moment worth a thousand tellings!"
 jason_race_events.2.c.tt:1 "Win or lose, no one else's racers make an impression like mine."
