 # What's a Study Day Worth?
 bp2_yearly.3000.t: "What's a Study Day Worth?"
 bp2_yearly.3000.desc: "The voice of [educator.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] drones on and on as [educator.GetSheHe] lectures me for the umpteenth time on the proper ways of a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], interspersed with austere quotes from the [educator.GetFaith.ReligiousText|U]."
 bp2_yearly.3000.desc_no_educator: "As I turn another page, I stare forlornly at the other children of the [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetCourt')] playing outside. The laughter, the joyful screams... I look back at the copy of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText|U] sitting on the table."
 bp2_yearly.3000.desc_ending: "\n\nCertainly, this is all very important for my future, but... Would anyone really notice if I snuck out for once — or maybe twice — to play?"
 bp2_yearly.3000.a: "Knowledge is the key to the universe!"
 bp2_yearly.3000.a.tt: "There's a chance your education will have a better outcome"
 bp2_yearly.3000.b: "A bit of effort can't hurt."
 bp2_yearly.3000.c: "Why study when you can #EMP play#!?"

 bp2_yearly.3010.desc: "My heart clenches as I see my beloved [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')], [child.GetFirstName], staring blankly at [child.GetHerHis] surroundings, once again confused and unrecognizing.\n\n[child.GetSheHe|U] took [child.GetHerHis] first steps in these very quarters, but that was long ago. The many years spent abroad as a hostage must have wiped the memories from [child.GetHerHis] young mind.\n\nOnce again, [child.GetSheHe] looks around and sighs."
 bp2_yearly.3010.a: "I need to talk to [child.GetHerHim]."
 bp2_yearly.3010.b: "[child.GetSheHe|U]'ll get over it."
 # I've Walked This Floor
 bp2_yearly.3011.t: "I've Walked This Floor"
 bp2_yearly.3011.desc: "In some corner of my mind, I #EMP know#! that I've been here before, but the memories are hazier than dreams, and dreams of home have lied to me before. After so many years spent abroad as a hostage, it's hard to even distinguish what is #EMP home#! and what is #EMP not#!...\n\nWas this hearth always here? Has this hallway always been so dark? I just don't know."
 bp2_yearly.3011.desc_parent: "\n\nAs I meet my [parent.GetMotherFather]'s eyes across the room, I see my own sadness mirrored in [parent.GetHerHis] eyes, and we hug tightly."
 bp2_yearly.3011.desc_no_parent: "\n\nAs I meet my [parent.GetMotherFather]'s eyes across the room, [parent.GetSheHe] only sighs and looks away."
 bp2_yearly.3011.a: "I'm a stranger now."
 bp2_yearly.3011.b: "I still belong here!"
 bp2_yearly.3010.a.tt: "[child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] embraced [child.GetHerHis] diversity"
 bp2_yearly.3010.b.tt: "[child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] clung to [child.GetHerHis] origins"
