 #Parent/Guardian: Your child/ward walks in on you performing your stress trait
 bp2_yearly.1000.t: "What Comes Around..."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_drunkard: ""One... one more round, schervant, if you pleashe... #EMP *hic*!#!"\n\nThe [ROOT.Char.Custom('RegionalAlcoholicDrink')] is ruining my speech, but I'm too snuggled up in its comfort to care at this point. To care about most things, actually.\n\nIn a great wet rush, the alcohol chooses to flee my body — all over my supper! The surrounding guests snort in disgust."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_hashishiyah: "The hashish is of excellent quality this time around — so strong, my skin starts itching and my clothes just feel #EMP too tight!#!\n\nI strip bare and, following a whim, chase some bird song outside. A moment later, I turn back..."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_reclusive: ""Cursed fools and rancid curs, all of them!" I mutter, as I finally take solitude in silence. I massage my temples and close my eyes.\n\nAn unexpected noise returns me to reality. My eyes snap open. #EMP Am I not alone, as I crave to be?!#! I mumble a curse."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_irritable: "It is late in the evening. Petty hangers-on gab all about me. My aching head drives nails into my thoughts.\n\nA dropped jug crashes to the floor next to me.\n\nWithout hesitation, I snap and scream at the offending servant: "You insolent #EMP [dummy_gender.Custom('InsultNounClumsy')]!#! Were you sired by a [dummy_gender.Custom('InsultAdjectiveClumsy')] ogre?!""
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_flagellant: "#EMP *CRACK!*#! My whip tears into me, furiously, #EMP again#! and #EMP again.#! The intense, isolated, burning pain focuses me.\n\nI give my body the lash just a few more times. Each strike brings me just a smidgeon closer to sweet absolution."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_profligate: "#EMP Hmm#! this looks good. Yes, that also. My chosen purchases made, I toss the fine wares to my servants.\n\nTurning around, I behold the full mound of frivolities I've amassed. It is getting rather... extensive. And my purse has become... quite empty."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_improvident: "An excellent sermon, a perfect rite. As we depart the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship], I — of course — dignify the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] with not only coins, but all the jewelry I can spare. Some look upon me, askance.\n\nBut gold is a fleeting thing! Heavier is the weight of guilt and shame..."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_contrite: "[other_guest.GetTitledFirstName] gawks at me, appalled by the intimate information I just confessed at supper. "You did #EMP what#!?" [other_guest.GetSheHe] repeats, confused.\n\nMy contriteness has its upsides — and downsides, admittedly. I feel unburdened... but is it because I am burdening others?"
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_comfort_eater: "I lean back in my chair, #EMP probably#! quite full, but yet another sultry treat slips across my lips. The rigors of my bustling morning feel just about buried.\n\nI realize I am surrounded by countless empty plates of [ROOT.Char.Custom('FavoriteTreat')]. Countless."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_inappetetic: "I poke at the food before me, moving it about to give the impression I've eaten. I wish to cause no concern.\n\nWho has time to eat? The day is for ruling; the night is for politicking. How can I get joy from food, while all this weighs on me?"
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_journaller: "I let out a sigh of relief, putting my writing materials aside. I let my eyes wander the length of my small, much-thumbed journal, a collection of scribbles that rarely leaves my side.\n\nRearing my head, I see that morning sunlight has given way to sunset. Just #EMP how#! long have I been belaboring my verbiage?"
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_confider: "Whether at morning meal or an informal function, I often lean over to my confidant, [confider_friend.GetTitledFirstName], and share my perspective on matters.\n\nHow good it is to hear my thoughts in my own words, to trust in a friend's opinions! With [confider_friend.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] advice on a petty matter attained, I look out over the busy table..."
 bp2_yearly.1000.desc_athletic: "I make another lap around the [ROOT.Char.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], sweat pouring down my back, catching some glances from bystanders. A strong body truly breeds a healthy mind!\n\nWith a roar, I pull to a stop; I grab a large rock and heave it up to my chest."
 bp2_yearly.1000.outro_bad: "\n\n...and then I spot [appropriate_child.GetTitledFirstName], my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))], staring right at me. #EMP Hmm.#!"

 #Follow-up; the child is mimicking your stress behavior
 bp2_yearly.1001.t: "...Goes Around"
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_drunkard: "The stores are #EMP usually#! secured; this is easily recalled due to the cook's incessant complaining about rats. Cautiously, I approach the murky, open [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetRoom')].\n\nMy [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] pops into view, mouth ajar, eyes glazed, [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] breath reeking of [ROOT.Char.Custom('RegionalAlcoholicDrink')] — and stolen treats."
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_hashishiyah: "A giggle comes from a seemingly-deserted [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetRoom')]. I stalk in, curious, and find my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] hidden in a corner.\n\n[appropriate_child.GetSheHe|U] tries to contain [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] mirth, but I #EMP know#! that crooked smile — not to mention the bloodshot eyes and palpable scent of hashish!"
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_reclusive: "My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] hasn't been seen about our residences for days. With the servants beginning to mutter and kin showing concern, I approach [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetChamber')].\n\nAs I enter — all #EMP is#! my domain, after all — [appropriate_child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] spins around with nary a formality or nicety, hissing at me to get out and leave [appropriate_child.GetHerHim] to solitude."
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_irritable: "On my way from dinner to privy, I come across a #EMP very#! furious [appropriate_child.GetFirstName].\n\n"#EMP You insolent [appropriate_child.Custom('InsultNounClumsy')]!#!" [appropriate_child.GetSheHe] howls. "You've stained my [appropriate_child.Custom('child_object_of_interest')]! Why don't you go drown yourself in that [ROOT.Char.Custom('RegionalDrink')]!?""
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_flagellant: "My [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetDungeonPlural')] reverberate with screams of pain... #EMP youthful#! screams. I hasten forth.\n\nSquinting, I see the culprit is my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] and... #EMP is that one of my whips?#! My jaw drops, as [appropriate_child.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] wounds [appropriate_child.GetHerselfHimself] in the name of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]."
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_profligate: "For the third time in as many weeks, [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] has pleaded for some expensive new toy. Peddlers hound our every movement from the [ROOT.Char.Custom('FortifiedBuilding')].\n\nThis makes me slightly concerned. After all, what if [appropriate_child.GetSheHe] were to have their own treasury someday? Such spending...\n\nAnd what's this? Has [appropriate_child.GetSheHe] bought the very same [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetAccessory')] I once purchased?"
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_improvident: "The past few days, I've noticed my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] giving away many of [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] toys to other children.\n\nIn the rare moments among the commons, [appropriate_child.GetSheHe] badgers me to give to beggars — and stops to weep at every poor widow's tale of woe!"
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_contrite: "Our very own [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] is standing atop a chest. [appropriate_child.GetSheHe|U] has gathered a crowd of children, regaling them with the most mundane secrets imaginable. In turn, [appropriate_child.GetSheHe] talks the children into revealing their own misdoings.\n\n"I-I took the last [appropriate_child.Custom('FavoriteTreat')]," one [dummy_gender.Custom('GirlBoy')] admits, shakily. "I killed a rat!" confides another child."
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_comfort_eater: "Going about my routine, I notice something unusual: my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName], sharing a hiding place with a mess of [appropriate_child.Custom('FavoriteTreat')], munching away.\n\nThere #EMP has#! been a lot going on here lately, and [appropriate_child.GetSheHe] #EMP has#! become a bit rounder..."
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_inappetetic: "At supper, my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] always seems impatient, gesturing at tray-bearing servants to leave her alone.\n\n Perhaps [appropriate_child.GetSheHe] is simply eager to leave for other activities? Or — if I'm not imagining things — are [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] cheeks getting a bit... pale and thin?"
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_journaller: "There has been an influx of hand-scribbled notes strewn about my [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetCourt')] recently. The source? My [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName], hunched over in an empty [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetChamber')], scribbling to [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] heart's content.\n\nI consider my own writing habit, my journal rich with my reflections. Perhaps I've shared a worthwhile practice."
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_confider: "I have noticed a subtle change in my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] recently. [appropriate_child.GetSheHe|U] is spending more time with [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] close friends, whispering and laughing.\n\nI swear those [appropriate_child.Custom('GirlBoyPlural')] know more about [appropriate_child.GetHerHim] than I do, and their bond seems strong. Friends like these, trusted friends that can be spoken with plainly, are truly a gift."
 bp2_yearly.1001.desc_athletic: "Stepping outside, children swoosh by: one is clearly faster and more agile than [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] peers.\n\n'Tis my very own [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('appropriate_child'))] [appropriate_child.GetFirstName] outpacing the rest!\n\nI grin encouragingly, impressed by [appropriate_child.GetHerHis] unexpected show of will and perseverance.
