 bm_1066_nomads: "At the Gates"
 bm_1066_nomads_desc: "Since time immemorial, peoples have migrated across the steppes, and followed the ways of the nomad for countless generations. Now, the world beyond encroaches on their homelands. Settled empires push their frontiers further and further every year.\n\n#bold Can the tide of settlement be turned back? Should the nomad's ways be cast aside? In towns and farms, the peoples of the steppe can find new lives... but, should a new age of great conquerors arise, the old ways could be saved!#!"

 bookmark_nomads_cumans: "Khan Saru of Cumania"
 bookmark_nomads_cumans_desc: "Fresh in the saddle, Saru commands the vast hordes of Cumania. On its frontiers rest rich principalities, ripe for the picking, but does Saru have the skill to keep the horde united for new conquests?\n\nCumania may be vast, but its people can be as much a liability as an asset — behind every mouth to feed is an ego that hungers just as much.\n\n#bold Can you keep your neighbors down and your status up as your ride at the forefront of the Cuman horde?#!"

 bookmark_nomads_keraits_hongji: "Khagan Hongji"
 bookmark_nomads_keraits_desc: "Exiled from China by decree of the Emperor Wuzong two centuries ago, Nestorian missionaries have found a receptive audience among the Keraits. Driven by ambition and faith, the Kerait lord Inanch now attempts to rally the peoples of the steppe to his banner — a banner topped with a cross.\n\n#bold Unite the nomads of the east, and spread the Nestorian creed across the steppes!#!"

 bookmark_nomads_late_kirghiz: "Kokotoy of the Kirghiz"
 bookmark_nomads_late_kirghiz_desc: "A whispered mention of the Kirghiz people used to send shivers down the spines of all who lived in the northern steppes. Those days are long gone — their empire shattered, and only a faint wisp of the Kirghiz Khaganate clings on in the north.\n\n#bold Will the last flickers of Kirghiz glory be snuffed out, or can its flame burn brighter than the Sun once more?#!"

 bookmark_nomads_eastern_karakhanids: "Muhmud of the Karluks"
 bookmark_nomads_eastern_karakhanids_desc: "The hordes of the Karakhanids — the #italic Black Khans#! — of Transoxiana once controlled the Silk Road, but those days of glory are long gone. Split between the houses of Ali and Hasan, the two halves of their empire now struggle for supremacy.\n\nIn the east, the Alids have forsaken their nomadic heritage, but the Hasanids in the west remain true to their nomadic roots.\n\n#bold The Karakhanids are divided — does the future of the Khanate rest on a saddle or in a palatial court?#!"

 bookmark_nomads_pechenegs: "Tatus of the Pechenegs"
 bookmark_nomads_pechenegs_desc: "The nomadic Pechenegs are surrounded by settled peoples: to the south, fractious Byzantine politics offer opportunities for raiders and sell-swords alike. Magyars have now settled in Pannonia to the west — but others have settled there before, only to be consumed by the next invaders. And, to the north, the princes of the Rus' constantly bicker in petty rivalries.\n\n#bold Lead the Pechenegs into a new age, growing and transforming to achieve whatever destiny awaits them!#!"
