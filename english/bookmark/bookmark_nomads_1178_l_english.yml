 bm_1178_nomads_desc: "The migratory movement of a nomadic people is an incredible sight to behold — a living, thronging sea of lives and livestock, venturing vast distances in search of pasturage.\n\nThe seemingly endless hoofbeats of their herds and flocks beat like a war drum, a reminder to sedentary neighbors that the hordes could strike at any moment! For what are such wandering tribes if not armies forever on the march?\n\n#bold The world of the sown lies ripe for any chieftain courageous enough to claim its bounty. Will you lead your tribe beyond the endless expanse and carve out an empire from horseback?#!"

 bookmark_nomads_togrul_desc: "The murder of his stepbrothers may have brought Togrul the chieftainship of the Keraits, but it was only through his friend and ally Yesügei that he was able to retain it. Twice was Togrul driven into exile, and twice did Yesügei return him to power.\n\nBut there can be no third time, for Yesügei lies dead, murdered by a rival tribe, and Togrul’s enemies are all too aware of his protector’s demise.\n\n#bold Your foes circle like wolves, and where lies the strength to fend them all off?#!"

Yet his resolve remains unbroken, and now he gathers bold riders under his banner.\n\n#bold Let the earth quake beneath the thunderous hooves of your endless hordes, and make the world bend to your will!#!"

 bookmark_nomads_jamukha_desc: "A formidable warrior in his own right, Jamukha has navigated boyhood with the aid of Temüjin, and in turn they have formed a bond stronger than those of blood. His innate pride compliments Temüjin's growing taste for power... but the two rarely agree on matters of leadership.\n\n#bold Sword of the Altai, shall you subjugate your #EMP anda#!, or perish in his shadow?#!"

 bookmark_nomads_koncek_desc: "From the Black Sea to the Altin Wastelands — all know his name. Unifying the Cumans under one banner, it is no easy feat to rule these volatile lands, and practice the tolerance one must to stay in power.\n\nThe princes of Russia look to tarnish his image once more, and in his aging, Könçek must invest in the battles to come, as one Khan cannot reign forever.\n\n#bold Your kin depend on you. Will you be the one to stand united, or will your people again fall to infighting and disarray?#!"
