 party_baron.1001.desc:0 "The name of a the lesser nobles seems to be on everybody's lips. I keep hearing about how [party_baron.GetTitledFirstName] is oh-so great to be around, how [party_baron.GetSheHe] makes everyone feel at ease, and how [party_baron.GetSheHe] hosts the #EMP best#! feasts.\n\nEveryone knows [party_baron.GetHerHim] and can vouch for his friendliness and generosity — at least that's what they're eager to claim."
 party_baron.1001.a:0 "Perhaps I could learn a thing or two from [party_baron.GetHerHis] popularity..."
 party_baron.1001.b:0 "But #EMP I#! am the one who should be heaped with praise!"

 party_baron.1002.a:0 "[party_baron.GetSheHe|U] seems very pleasant, even by letter!"

 party_baron.1003.desc:0 "It feels as if I blinked for a moment, and missed it entirely, but [party_baron.GetFirstName] has gone from [party_baron.GetHerHis] lowly barony, to being my [party_baron_header.GetTitleAsName]...\n\nThe world has turned upside down faster than I could imagine."

 party_baron.2001.positive:0 "It seems that [party_baron.GetShortUIName], entirely of [party_baron.GetHerHis] own initiative, has spoken to [vassal.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char )] about me.\n\nIt might have been cause for concern, if not for the fact that [vassal.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] now seems far more friendly and supportive!"

 party_baron.2002.b:0 "Oh, I have more than enough acquaintances as it is."

 party_baron.2003.desc:0 "It came to my attention that [owner.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] has been plotting to murder you!\n\nWorry not, however, because I spoke to [owner.GetHerHim] and made [owner.GetHerHim] see the error of [owner.GetHerHis] ways.

Even more so when [party_baron.GetSheHe] wants to speak, just the two of us.\n\n"I didn't want this to be said at a feast or a celebration." [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] seems unusually serious, that lighthearted smile missing for once. "I cannot describe how much you mean to me. I have many friends, but none other such as you. I hope we keep that friendship until the end of our days.""
 party_baron.2005.a:0 ""Me too, [party_baron.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. Me too."

 party_baron.2006.desc:0 "Having been invited to a feast for "a very special occasion," I had to see [party_baron.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] celebration for myself. What a night it was.\n\nI can scarce remember being happier, and now it feels as if I have regained some of my lust for life!"
 party_baron.2006.a:0 "Look out, world!"
 party_baron.2006.b:0 "It was nothing special."

 party_baron.2007.desc:0 "Even in the middle of a war, [party_baron.GetTitledFirstName] finds ways to get up to [party_baron.GetHerHis] usual tricks.

 party_baron.3001.desc:0 "People are head over heels for [party_baron.GetTitledFirstName], and I just don't understand why! [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] is not that great. All [party_baron.GetSheHe] does is act friendly and celebrate the good things about the people [party_baron.GetSheHe] meets! Yes, even having disagreements with [party_baron.GetHerHim] can be pleasant and friendly, and [party_baron.GetSheHe] stands for [party_baron.GetHerHis] convictions while trying to understand yours, but that's still not...\n\nMy point is, why do they love [party_baron.GetHerHim] so much?!"

 party_baron.3002.a:0 "Oh, I'll show those uppity cretins some "foul words.""
 party_baron.3002.b:0 "It doesn't hurt to be a little gentler. In public."

 party_baron.3003.desc:0 "Even after everything I have said about [party_baron.GetHerHim], [party_baron.GetTitledFirstName] remains undeterred. [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] even dares approach me at a feast, alone.\n\n"I have a feeling you don't like me very much." I snort. [party_baron.GetSheHe|U] can say that again. But of course instead [party_baron.GetSheHe] continues without flinching. "Could we talk for a moment?"\n\nEverything that happens next is a blur, but it turned into one of the best feasts of my life. I must admit, perhaps I was wrong about the [party_baron.GetTitleAsName] after all..."

 party_baron.3003.b:0 "No! Nothing has changed!"

 party_baron.3004.desc:0 "This has gone on long enough! The fact that [party_baron.GetTitledFirstName] keeps being elevated as some beacon of everything good in humanity is driving me mad!\n\nWhatever manipulative spell [party_baron.GetSheHe] has the realm under needs to be broken."
 party_baron.3004.a:0 "#EMP [party_baron.GetSheHe|U]#! needs to be broken!"
 party_baron.3004.b:0 "Am I... going too far?"

 party_baron.4001.desc:1 "The loss of [previous_character.Custom2('YourCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] has been hard to accept. [previous_character.GetSheHe|U] was a good friend, and you should be proud of the [previous_character.GetWomanMan] [previous_character.GetSheHe] was.\n\nThis must be a difficult time for you, but know that you have my support!"
 party_baron.4001.a:0 "Thank you for your kind words."

 party_baron.4002.desc:0 "I understand that you do not like me. That is your right.

Please, let us simply... be friends."
 party_baron.4002.a:0 "How dare [party_baron.GetSheHe]? How dare [party_baron.GetSheHe]!"

 party_baron.9001.desc:0 "[party_baron.GetTitledFirstName] is a stark reminder that no matter how much we enjoy life, and no matter how much joy we bring to this world, it will all come to an end eventually."
