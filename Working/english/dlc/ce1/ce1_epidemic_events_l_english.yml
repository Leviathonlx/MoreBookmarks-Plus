 epidemic_events.5010.santiago: "Precious few feet now fall on the Way of St. James. Only the hardiest and most fervent still walk the path towards the plague-stricken city, seeking salvation from the almighty even as they themselves succumb to the loathsome sickness.\n\nThe beautiful plazas, so often filled with cheer and good-natured barter, are the refuge of the damned. The dead and the dying rattle their last here, pitifully alone."
 epidemic_events.5010.london: "The gentle tides of the Thames carry more than just silt and traders now. Bloated, sun-bleached corpses are deposited downriver, their agonised faces set in a silent rictus grin, popped buboes livid against the pale skin.\n\nThe old Roman walls, so many times a guardian against incursion from the living, are now buttressed with the dead. The twisting, narrow streets have become a maze of stacked corpses, rats using the piles as both refuge and sustenance."
 epidemic_events.5010.rome: "Rome! Glorious Rome. The Capital of the World.\n\nCountless souls have walked these venerable roads, but the ranks of the dead swell more swiftly day by day. The scourge sweeps the streets, blighting every pretty plaza and glorious archway. The old marbles stand silently, helpless against the torture of the living. The dying rattle their last, on their lips the words scarcely dared thought of in better times:\n\n"Just how perpetual is the Eternal City?""
 epidemic_events.5010.paris: "The winding waters of the Seine lap happily against the Île de la Cité's shores, belying the catastrophe on the land.\n\nThe sick shamble hopelessly between ramshackle buildings. Where bakers once hawked their wares lie piles of dead, the living unable to keep up with the tide of sickness constricting the city.\n\nThe scene would nearly be peaceful, were it not for the groans and coughs of the dying."
 epidemic_events.5010.constantinople: "The City of World's Desire. The Queen of Cities. The Door to Happiness. The Crossroads of the World.\n\nSuch grand and resplendent names are bestowed on the mighty metropolis, draped across its glimmering promontary since time immemorial. So venomously ironic do those same names feel now, with the diseased and debilitated picking their miserable way through the corpses of those that have already succumbed.\n\nDo they take any comfort in those past glories as they die?"
 epidemic_events.5010.prague: "The marketplaces and trading squares of the city, so usually bustling with activity, have fallen deathly silent. The proud bridges across the Vltava are clogged with the sick, the dead causing logjams amidst the spans below.\n\nVyšehrad overlooks the carnage sadly, its stern walls founded by Duke Krok so many generations ago unable to stop so deadly and silent a killer as the dreaded pestilence.\n\nThe City of a Hundred Spires dies slowly, those vaunted steeples unable to keep the sky from falling."
 epidemic_events.5010.toledo: "What city is more known for its steel than Toledo? The waters of the Tagus have been used to quench the blades of a million swords, but there are some threats no amount of fine craftsmanship can protect from.\n\nIt is a grim irony that so diverse a place should be so suddenly united in the face of such adversity. The sickness kills without prejudice, laying low all from every walk of life.\n\nThe ancient smithies fall silent. Those who worked them turn their calloused hands to prayer rather than toil, in hope that the divine may save them where a weapon would not."
 epidemic_events.5010.cairo: "Ancient beyond measure, Cairo has watched sister cities in Memphis and Heliopolis rise and fall, yet still it stands strong. It has endured much, but it will need to endure further still.\n\nThe Nile, the River of Life, today carries death with it as it flows. The malignant dead are carried away by its waters to fester in the muddy deltas where it meets the sea, but more and yet more replace them. Nilometers suffocate with bodies, thrown desperately into their throats to save time, save space, save the living.\n\nThe old city withers."
 epidemic_events.5010.kanyakubja: "Nobody knows just how many generations have lived and died here, but all agree that the city itself is impossibly ancient. It will require all its experience and wisdom to survive this threat.\n\nThe famed perfume distilleries continue churning out attars, camelskin bottles filled to the brim and worn around the healthy's necks to ward off the evil smells.\n\nElsewhere, however, the only sounds echoing from the walls are the groans of the dead and the dying, their bodies stacked to impossible heights in the narrow alleyways."
 epidemic_events.5010.varanasi: "It is more commonly known as the City of Light, but Varanasi has been the City of the Dead for just as long. It seems fitting, then, that it should play host to this most deadly of pestilences.\n\nIn happier times, the Ganges teems with life; now, it carries only the dead. Their bloated corpses catch on the riverbanks, kicked away by the few remaining living people who dare to venture outside.\n\nThe sounds of weeping and coughing bounce off the ancient stones of this antediluvian city."
 epidemic_events.5010.fallback: "The winding streets and piled housing, so usually bustling with teeming masses, lie silent. Only the pitiful wails of the bereaved and the hacking wet coughs of those soon to join the mounting dead break the still."
