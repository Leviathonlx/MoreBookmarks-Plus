 # #Flavour Events
 bp2_yearly.0601.t: "Ruling Rightly"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.intro: "As my [ROOT.Char.GetDiarchTitle], [regent.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] seems determined to teach me [regent.GetHerHis] preferred methods of rule."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.rationale.disloyal.likes_you: "[regent.GetSheHe|U]'s something of a rogue as a [ROOT.Char.GetDiarchTitle], but nevertheless, the [regent.GetWomanMan] seems to have taken a shine to tutoring.\n\n"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.rationale.neutral.likes_you: "[regent.GetSheHe|U]'s hardly the most invested [ROOT.Char.GetDiarchTitle], but nevertheless, the [regent.GetWomanMan] takes the time to tutor me when [regent.GetSheHe] can.\n\n"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.rationale.loyal.predecessor_hook: "It's rare that these lessons go by without the [regent.GetWomanMan] reminding me about the oath [regent.GetSheHe] took to my predecessor.\n\n"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.rationale.loyal.loyalty_hook: "Invariably, the lessons begin with the [regent.GetWomanMan] reiterating that [regent.GetSheHe] swore to be true to me in all things, including learning.\n\n"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.rationale.loyal.honourable: "Methods that always seem to somehow circle back to honor, the strict rules by which it is enforced, and how it can be obtained.\n\n"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.rationale.loyal.fallback: "The lessons are long, but seem to come from the goodness of [regent.GetHerHis] heart, or at least [regent.GetHerHis] affection for me.\n\n"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.rationale.fallback: "Why [regent.GetSheHe] does this, I've never been able to work out, but sometimes the [regent.GetWomanMan] insists.\n\n"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.skill.boilerplate: "Today's class covers #EMP yet more#!"
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.diplomacy.arrogant: "statecraft. To [regent.GetHerHim], everything seems to come down to putting others in their place, conveying power, and growing your majesty. Words are the means by which [regent.GetSheHe] establishes true dominance."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.diplomacy.humble: "statecraft. For [regent.GetHerHim], the key seems to be empathy — the person you're speaking to might be beneath you, but modesty in diplomacy becomes magnanimity, and magnanimity implicitly comes from a position of strength."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.diplomacy.fallback: "statecraft. Good posture, fine speaking, rhetoric, the intricacies of negotiation — all the usual faff and bluster adult politics seem so obsessed with."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.martial.wrathful: "military theory. [regent.GetSheHe|U]'s practically frothing throughout, emphasizing that once battle is joined, violence should be dealt quickly and generously to ensure victory. Giving quarter invites loss."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.martial.calm: "military theory. [regent.GetSheHe|U] focuses on the benefits of restraint in planning, of running a lean army, of using strategy to minimize how many lives are expended in the fight. For [regent.GetHerHim], care and calm bring victory."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.martial.fallback: "military theory. Where to pitch a camp, how to care for large numbers of horses on campaign, which formations work best against our traditional enemies, and on, and on, and on..."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.stewardship.greedy: "commerce and taxes. Nothing gets [regent.GetHerHim] fired up quite like commerce and taxes. The look of gleeful avarice writ [regent.Custom('MaskFace_BehindAcross')] [regent.GetHerHis] [regent.Custom('MaskFace')] seems almost ecstatic, enthralled with the many ways to obtain silver, carefully enumerating them one by one for hours at a time."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.stewardship.generous: "commerce and taxes. For [regent.GetHerHim], silver is a means to an end, and that end is more important than possessing wealth for its own sake. Coin must be taken by a ruler, yes, but only when necessary, and always returned freely."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.stewardship.fallback: "commerce and taxes. Taxes and commerce. An endless, morphable screed on the fine details of coinage, the best methods of extracting wealth, and the myriad ways in which commoner and noble alike might try to hide my due from me."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.intrigue.compassionate: "political manoeuvring. For [regent.GetHerHim], the question is how best to fight your way through the viper's nest without bloodying your hands unless absolutely necessary."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.intrigue.callous: "political manoeuvring. [regent.GetSheHe|U] speaks in short, absolute sentences and gives quick judgements, always. Rivals are to be dealt with promptly, by force or by charm, neither met with needless punishment nor foolish mercy."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.intrigue.sadistic: "political manoeuvring. [regent.GetSheHe|U] spends most of the time relishing inventive descriptions of punishments for rivals, discussing the finer points of cultivating a reputation, and reiterating that it is easier to be feared than loved."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.intrigue.fallback: "political manoeuvring. Guarding against conspiracy, exerting power through implication, which offices hold secret influence, and so on. Worse, much of the lesson itself is layered double-meanings and inference."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.learning.shy: "scholasticism and theology. As soft-spoken as [regent.GetSheHe] is, I can barely hear [regent.GetHerHim], but [regent.GetSheHe] mumbles on at length regardless, speaking of the many lessons of rule to be found in the works of past luminaries."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.learning.gregarious: "scholasticism and theology. Booming and heartfelt, [regent.GetSheHe] reels off a list of [regent.GetHerHis] favorite historians and philosophers, of rising academic stars and hotly-debated theories, and how learning benefits ruler and ruled alike."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.learning.fallback: "scholasticism and theology. It's a dry screed on history, philosophy, strange-smelling academics from far-flung lands, all the usual tripe, but [regent.GetHerHis] central point seems to be that an educated ruler makes for a happy populace."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.child_reaction.disgust: "\n\nThis just sounds wrong to me. There's something horrifying about imagining [regent.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] treating [regent.GetHerHis] lessers like this, and imagining that that's a #EMP good#! thing."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.child_reaction.admiration: "\n\nSomething about this feels fundamentally right to me. [regent.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] understands the true order of things, that this is how proper nobility #EMP should#! comport itself."
 bp2_yearly.0601.desc.child_reaction.boredom: "\n\nI find [regent.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] views on this #EMP utterly#! disinteresting, but I'm stranded in this lecture. Surely I'll have plenty of time to learn all this when I'm [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] all by myself?"
 bp2_yearly.0601.option.skill: "Pay attention to the technical details."

 bp2_yearly.0611.desc.regent_opinion.negative: "I know [regent.GetSheHe] doesn't much care for me, but am I so wretched that every visit must be always"
 bp2_yearly.0611.desc.regent_opinion.fallback: "I know [regent.GetSheHe] thinks I'm just a child, but surely I must still be worth a little time? Instead, visits are always entirely"
