Though we are without lands or titles, the [prince_parent.GetTitleAsNamePossessiveNoTooltip|U] [prospective_prince.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] is utterly drunk with infatuation. A charming courtship to behold, but now the time has come for the two to be separated as we go on for further ventures.\n\n"Oh, [ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather],"

This creature is clearly unkempt and road-weary, dirt smattering [romantic_child.GetHerHis] modest clothing.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather|U]! This is [romantic_child.GetFirstName], [romantic_child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] of [laamp.GetName], the famous adventurer. [romantic_child.GetSheHe|U] is also the [romantic_child.GetWomanMan] I have fallen in love with, and if you'll give your blessing, we shall be married!""

As [romantic_child.GetSheHe] finally reaches me, I am embraced in a tight hug. It would appear that [prince_parent.GetName] did not bless this union, and [romantic_child.GetName] returns to join me on my travels."

The tomb appears to be cracked open, and just within its mouth I see the glimmer of some unknown treasure.\n\nNone but my party appear to be around, and surely whomever once owned the contents of this tomb would not cast judgement on me for taking what would go otherwise unused?"
