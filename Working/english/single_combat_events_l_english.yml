 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.taunt.fatality:0 "that [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] grows so incensed that [sc_loser.GetHerHis] guard breaks entirely in a fit of pique.\n\nGiven an open path to [sc_loser.GetHerHis] belly, I reward [sc_loser.GetHerHis] impatience with a slow death."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.put_the_boot_in.fatality:0 "The dual-strike shreds [sc_loser.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] guard, and I'm able to first disarm [sc_loser.GetHerHim] with a [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedLight')], then transition swiftly into a lethal chest-shot that gouges a bloody wedge straight through to [sc_loser.GetHerHis] heart.\n\nThere are slower deaths to be had."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.strict_guard.fatality:0 "The first strike smashes a gaping hole in [sc_loser.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] guard, the second robs [sc_loser.GetHerHim] of the use of [sc_loser.GetHerHis] [sc_loser.Custom('signature_weapon')]-arm. My opponent stumbles, lucidity fading amidst an avalanche of pain.\n\nI take my time lining up the next blow, [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponWoundVerb1PresentParticiple')] deep into the [sc_loser.GetWomanMan]'s chest with my [sc_victor.Custom('signature_weapon')].\n\nThe next attack simply cuts the pain short."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.confident_attack.fatality:0 "When I judge the time to be right, I switch up my pattern with a surprise side-swipe that takes [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] right in the belly.\n\nThe strike hurls my foe backwards, something red and vital looking sliding limply out of the new hole as [sc_loser.GetSheHe] topples to the ground.\n\nI approach with some caution, but it soon becomes clear that shock is setting in. Taking a moment to kick away [sc_loser.GetHerHis] [sc_loser.Custom('signature_weapon')] just in case, I prepare to put [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] out of [sc_loser.GetHerHis] misery."

 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.attempt_disarm.fatality:0 "Giving no quarter, I throw myself into a [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavy')] that [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponWoundVerb4ThirdPersonPresent')] clean through [sc_loser.GetHerHis] rib cage.\n\nI continue to attack [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] as [sc_loser.GetSheHe] staggers to the ground, sluggish and listless, stopping only when the only movements the corpse makes are from my blows."
 ### No need for a lightning_assault, as you can't end the duel in the first round.
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.tire_opponent.fatality:0 "It's quite a while before a suitable gap opens in [sc_loser.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] guard, but when it does, it's all I need. With a single [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavy')] from my [sc_victor.Custom('signature_weapon')], I tear through [sc_loser.GetHerHis] belly and into [sc_loser.GetHerHis] stomach.\n\nGore, bile, and my opponent's last meal flood out, showering my lower half, and [sc_loser.GetSheHe] lets out an ear-splitting scream.\n\nIt is, perhaps, a kindness when I end [sc_loser.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] suffering early."

Thankfully, [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] falls dead face-down, sparing us both the misery."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.technique_from_legend.fatality:0 "With more hope than belief, I charge [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], [sc_victor.Custom('signature_weapon')] out in perfect imitation of the stories, eyes screwed shut by reflex.\n\nThere's a sudden stone-hard force to my [sc_victor.Custom('signature_weapon')], the sound of wet flesh sheared in half, and a spasm passes up my arm. I open my eyes, almost certain I'll see my own doom, only to be met with the #EMP annihilated#! neck stump of [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], fountaining blood into the air with reckless abandon.\n\nBy the time I've located [sc_loser.GetHerHis] head, the light has long since gone from the [sc_loser.GetWomanMan]'s [sc_loser.Custom('EyeEyes')]."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.like_a_viper.fatality:0 "[sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] rushes to parry, but isn't even close to stopping me.\n\nI sail straight past [sc_loser.GetHerHis] feeble block, [sc_victor.Custom('signature_weapon')]-[sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponTipType')] plunging into the [sc_loser.GetWomanMan]'s chest.\n\nHard cracks and wet pops mark bones breaking and organs puncturing for what feels like an eternity, till my weapon punches clean through to the other side.\n\nIt's almost impossible to tell at which point in the blow [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] died."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.pocket_silver.fatality:0 "[sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] dodges the purse, but doesn't see my follow-up blow.\n\nThe [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavy')] takes [sc_loser.GetHerHim] right in the jaw, ripping loose flesh, teeth, and bone. [sc_loser.GetSheHe|U] tries to scream, but can't through [sc_loser.GetHerHis] ruin of a mouth.\n\nIt's arguably a kindness when I put [sc_loser.GetHerHim] out of [sc_loser.GetHerHis] misery."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.martial_voice.fatality:0 "\n\nWith zero forewarning, my screamed obscenities turn to a [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedHeavy')]. [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is still so lost in horror at my words that [sc_loser.GetSheHe] doesn't even try to parry the blow.\n\nMetal meets flesh and bone, [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponWoundVerb2PresentParticiple')] deep into my foe's shoulder. We both know the blood flow that results is too heavy to be survived."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.mocking_boast.fatality:0 "kill them. [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is so stunned by my remarks that [sc_loser.GetSheHe] fails to stop me wrenching the [sc_loser.Custom('signature_weapon')] from [sc_loser.GetHerHis] grip.\n\nMy foe has just enough time to register exactly how things are going to end before I [sc_victor.Custom2('SignatureWeaponKillTypeThirdPersonFutureGendered',SCOPE.sC('sc_loser'))]."

 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.desert_warrior.fatality:0 "and all I have to do is kick the knees out from under [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nThe second [sc_loser.GetSheHe]'s in the [sc_defender.Custom('GroundType')], it's over. One [sc_victor.Custom('SignatureWeaponAttemptedLight')] [sc_victor.Custom2('SignatureWeaponKillTypeTorsoThirdPersonActiveGendered',SCOPE.sC('sc_loser'))].\n\nAfter that, there's nothing left for [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to do but die."

My opponent crumples within seconds, overwhelmed by excruciating pain.\n\nI raise my weapon for the coup de grâce."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.rough_terrain_expert.fatality.rocky:0 "It takes more effort than I'd like, but I'm eventually able to force [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] backwards over a small drop, causing [sc_loser.GetHerHim] to cascade down the incline in a cacophony of suddenly-broken limbs.\n\nBy the time I've caught up with [sc_loser.GetHerHim], my [sc_victor.Custom('signature_weapon')]'s bite is more welcome release than anything else."
 single_combat.0041.desc.sc_attacker.rough_terrain_expert.fatality.boggy:0 "With sufficient shoving, I'm eventually able to send [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] face-first into a deep pool of foetid water.\n\n[sc_loser.GetHerHis|U] weapon is lost straight away, and with deliberate expertise I plant a boot on the back of the [sc_loser.GetWomanMan]'s neck.\n\nStruggle as [sc_loser.GetSheHe] might, between my [sc_victor.Custom('signature_weapon')] and my foot, [sc_loser.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] can't bring [sc_loser.GetHerHis] head above water.
