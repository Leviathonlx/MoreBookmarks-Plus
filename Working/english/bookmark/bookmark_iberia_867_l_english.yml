 bm_867_iberia_desc:3 "The old powers of Iberia are breaking.\n\nIn the north, Asturias is rife with ambitious vassals, straining to be free.\n\nIn the south, al-Andalus waxes strong but faces rumblings of discontent. The border military districts mutter about independence and intrigue plagues the ruling Umayyads.\n\nHungry foreign powers eye Iberia's rich lands covetously.\n\n#bold Centuries in the making, the $game_concept_iberian_struggle$ enters a new phase, and whether it ends in blood or brotherhood lies on a roll of the dice."
