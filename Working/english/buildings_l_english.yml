 building_curtain_walls_06:1 "Outer Baileys"
 building_curtain_walls_06_desc:1 "More walls mean more baileys, and by extension, more safe storage for supplies. With baileys this many, we can even store an entire stable's worth of knightly mounts within the walls — an excellent thing, should we run out of pickled boar's heads..."

 building_curtain_walls_08:1 "Ravelins & Cavaliers"
 building_curtain_walls_08_desc:1 "The cavalier is a raised platform which allows our soldiers to fire over the main parapet, right at the enemies!

 building_cereal_fields_07:1 "Vast Crop Fields"
 building_cereal_fields_07_desc:2 "By encouraging the peasantry to till more and larger fields close to each other's lands, we can increase productivity, although encroaching on each other's lands might bring conflict between the farmers."

 building_barracks_07_desc:1 "By constructing dedicated conscription centers in all nearby villages, we ensure a steady stream of ill-willed, alcoholized troublemakers to swell our ranks."

 building_camel_farms_07:1 "Armorers"
 building_camel_farms_07_desc:1 "Making armor for camels is not an easy task, but the reward is well worth it. A charge by fearsome fully-armored camels can make any horse-based army turn their tail and flee."
