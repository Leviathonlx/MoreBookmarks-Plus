 child_personality.0021.a:0 "Then my imagination can do the rest..."

 child_personality.0022.desc:0 "I have grown used to being alone. No one to talk to, no one to play with, no one to learn with. The mere thought of another person touching me now..."
 child_personality.0022.a:0 "It sends shivers down my spine!"

 child_personality.0023.desc:0 "I never know when I am going to get my next meal, so when a plate is given to me I devour all that is on it with no hesitation, no matter the amount.\n\nOnly when I am full do I feel somewhat at ease."
 child_personality.0023.a:0 "It is one of the few joys I have!"

 child_personality.0024.desc:0 "I never know when I am going to get my next meal, so when a plate is given to me I force myself to ransom the food and be satisfied with what I get.\n\nIn the beginning it was hard, but now it is second nature."
 child_personality.0024.a:0 "Moderation is key."

 child_personality.0025.desc:0 "A discarded spoon, a shiny pebble, a broken plate... Once I would have scoffed at such trinkets, but I have come to realize that nothing is truly worthless!"
 child_personality.0025.a:0 "I gather all the treasures I can find."

 child_personality.0026.desc:0 "When one owns nothing an act of kindness means everything – I have learned this the hard way. It is mind-blowing to think of the impact I can have upon people with a simple act of generosity!"
 child_personality.0026.a:0 "What is mine is... everyone's!"

 child_personality.0027.desc:0 "My days idle by in a haze stuck behind these bars. I wake, I pace, I – hopefully – eat...\n\nIt makes no difference if I try to fill my days with activity or not. It makes no difference if I try at all."
 child_personality.0027.a:0 "I'll just go back to sleep."

 child_personality.0028.desc:0 "My days idle by in a haze stuck behind these bars. I wake, I pace, I – hopefully – eat...\n\nTo fill my days with something I have learned to give myself tasks, and to complete them well."
 child_personality.0028.a:0 "Diligence is key!"

 child_personality.0029.desc:0 "The simpering guards following my every move, the [imprisoner.Custom('InsultAdjective')] [imprisoner.Custom('InsultNoun')] [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstName] keeping me locked up, the scuttling rats in dark corners... There is an anger growing inside of me, and it is getting stronger for every day that passes!"
 child_personality.0029.a:0 "I... just... ARGH!"

 child_personality.0030.desc:0 "There is little I can do to affect my situation, both on a day to day basis and in the broader sense. There is little to do, and little to say."
 child_personality.0030.a:0 "I have learned to take it in stride."

 child_personality.0031.desc:0 "There is little I can do to affect my situation, both on a day to day basis and in the broader sense. I just have to wait and see what happens."
 child_personality.0031.a:0 "Patience is key."

 child_personality.0032.desc:0 "If being stuck behind bars has taught me anything it is that things cannot wait; you never know what is going to happen in a day, in an hour, in a minute! Will I even be alive?"
 child_personality.0032.a:0 "I cannot waste the time I have!"

 child_personality.0033.desc:0 "When they threw me in here I questioned it; why would they keep me behind bars?\n\nAs the days go by I have come to realize that it is because they fear me; they fear what I will become, and therefore they have locked me away."
 child_personality.0033.a:0 "I am just that good!"

 child_personality.0034.desc:0 "When they threw me in here I questioned it; why would they keep me behind bars?\n\nAs the days go by I have come to realize that I must have done something to deserve it and that I should be grateful for all that life decides to give me despite that."
 child_personality.0034.a:0 "I do not ask for much."

 child_personality.0035.desc:0 "If being stuck behind bars has taught me anything it is that nothing in this life is free; to get what you want you have to cheat and you have to lie. I am lucky my guards are so easily tricked!"
 child_personality.0035.a:0 "Only fools tell the truth."

 child_personality.0036.desc:0 "If being stuck behind bars has taught me anything it is that people do not hesitate to dole out punishment, and the best thing I can do is to not give them any reason to. Also, someone is #EMP always#! watching."
 child_personality.0036.a:0 "Lying only leads to trouble anyway."

 child_personality.0037.desc:0 "The guards outside of my prison are as burly as they are bitter, and they watch every move I make.\n\nBut when I try to hide it is only a matter of time before rats, or something worse, sneak up on me!"
 child_personality.0037.a:0 "Every day brings a new fear..."

 child_personality.0038.desc:0 "The guards outside of my prison are as burly as they are bitter, and they watch every move I make. There are rats in the dark, and every day brings a new horror.\n\n[imprisoner.GetTitledFirstName] will have to up [imprisoner.GetHerHis] game if [imprisoner.GetSheHe] wants to scare me now!"
 child_personality.0038.a:0 "I fear nothing."

 child_personality.0039.desc:0 "It has been a long time since I saw another person, and I do not know if I am devastated or relieved.\n\nOn the one hand I am longing for #EMP any#! kind of social contact after so long behind bars, but on the other hand I never know what to say anymore..."
 child_personality.0039.a:0 "People are scary!"

 child_personality.0040.desc:0 "Spending all day every day behind bars gets so #EMP boring#!! One of the few things that give me joy is the conversations I am able to strike up with the guards; they may be brutes, but some of them are surprisingly interesting!"
 child_personality.0040.a:0 "Please, tell me more!"

 child_personality.0041.desc:0 "Thinking about all the things that pass me by while I waste away behind these bars keep me awake at night; all those opportunities, gone...\n\nWhen I finally get out of this rotten hole of a prison I am going to make up for all the time I have lost!"
 child_personality.0041.a:0 "Nothing will stop me!"

 child_personality.0042.desc:0 "Stuck in this prison I have learned that I do not need much to get by; opulence and wealth have no inherent value.\n\nWhen I finally get out of here I am going to cherish all the things I have!"
 child_personality.0042.a:0 "No matter their worth."

 child_personality.0043.desc:0 "Behind these bars I have learned a valuable lesson: the only one you can truly trust is yourself. What does the opinion of other people mean in the end? For that matter, what do other people matter at all?"
 child_personality.0043.a:0 "They do not!"

 child_personality.0044.desc:0 "The unfairness I have seen in this prison – both from guards and other prisoners – is enough to give me nightmares.\n\nIf we cannot treat each other justly, then what point is there?!"
 child_personality.0044.a:0 "Without laws we are no better than animals."

 child_personality.0045.desc:0 "People are selfish; if my time behind bars has taught me anything it is this.\n\nAn unexpectedly decent meal? Prisoners will do everything in their power to steal from each other. A taunting guard asking them to renounce [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] for a treat? No hesitation."
 child_personality.0045.a:0 "People only care about themselves."

 child_personality.0046.desc:0 "The one and only constant during my time behind bars have been [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNameAlternate]. Whenever I have been down, whenever I doubted, [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodNameSheHe] has been there for me in my prayers.\n\nAs the days pass by I am growing more and more certain that nothing truly matters besides my faith."
 child_personality.0046.a:0 "Praise [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"

 child_personality.0047.desc:0 "Wherever I go the guards are there, watching. Even when I believe me alone they later drop a comment that assures me they saw everything; that I always have eyes upon me."
 child_personality.0047.a:0 "Someone is always watching..."

 child_personality.0048.desc:0 "[imprisoner.GetTitledFirstName] said I would be clothed and I would be fed, and I have been. The guards promised that I would not see the light of day, and I have not.\n\nThe one thing I have grown certain of behind these bars is that people usually tell the truth."
 child_personality.0048.a:0 "I trust them."

 child_personality.0049.desc:0 "There is little happiness to find behind these bars, and the smallest gesture of kindness goes a long way. To see the joy in other people's eyes, to see their spirits rise... Nothing brings me such calm."
 child_personality.0049.a:0 "Kindness is all that matters."

 child_personality.0050.desc:0 "The unfairness I have seen in this prison – both from guards and other prisoners – is enough to give me nightmares. Or... it was. Now nothing can surprise me anymore."
 child_personality.0050.a:0 "Everyone is capable of cruelty."

 child_personality.0051.desc:0 "Joy is scarce behind these bars. The guards are as unfriendly as they are burly, [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstName] is either curt or hostile, and my fellow prisoners are hurting to deeply too entertain me. Or... so I thought. Whenever one of them is in pain I feel the remnants of joy stirring in my soul."
 child_personality.0051.a:0 "This feeling... I want more!"

 child_personality.0052.desc:0 "Other people decide what I eat, when and where I sleep, where I go... The one thing I have behind these bars is my conviction, and I will not compromise."
 child_personality.0052.a:0 "I am the only constant in this place."

 child_personality.0053.desc:0 "It has been so long since I was free that I do not remember what it was like to hold my life in my own hands; to make my own decisions. Now even the most straightforward question can throw me.\n\nEven though I sometimes have a hard time knowing my preferences it also opens so many doors!"
 child_personality.0053.a:0 "Who knows what I want to do?"

 child_personality.0054.desc:0 "If someone slights you, and you readily forgive and forget, they will certainly slight you again. The guards, and other prisoners, have taught me that.\n\nLuckily there is little to do in this prison but remember."
 child_personality.0054.a:0 "[imprisoner.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], I will have my revenge."

 child_personality.0055.desc:0 "When you are stuck with the same people day in and day out you realize that nothing is back and white; people always have a reason for acting the way they do, and most everyone is trying their best.\n\nI would have only enemies around me in this prison if I did not forgive."
 child_personality.0055.a:0 "To keep hold of grudges only brings pain."

 child_personality.0061.t:0 "A Guardian's Influence"
 child_personality.0061.desc_opening:0 "I don't enjoy loneliness, yet I struggle to enjoy the company of others. There's always a feeling of worry that I'm making a fool of myself during social interactions."
