 dungeon_ongoing.0001.desc:0 "I cannot see who it is, or exactly where they are, but the only time their loud whispers are not echoing through the dank dungeon is when they are screaming instead."
 dungeon_ongoing.0001.a:0 "If you would only stop, even for a moment!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0001.b:0 ""Is it me you're talking to, friend?""

 dungeon_ongoing.0002.t:0 "The Wait"
 dungeon_ongoing.0002.desc:0 "It is the passing of time that really gets to me. Who knows how much has gone, or how much longer I my stay will continue? It could be hours... or months."
 dungeon_ongoing.0002.a:0 "I need to get out of here!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0002.b:0 "I can wait as long as I need to."

 dungeon_ongoing.0003.t:0 ""Keep It Down!""
 dungeon_ongoing.0003.desc:0 "I have been haranguing the guards through the bars, telling them that they need to let me out. Their only response is a menacing look, a raised fists, and a snarl to 'keep quiet.'"
 dungeon_ongoing.0003.a:0 "Appeals to duty are clearly not the way out."
 dungeon_ongoing.0003.b:0 "You think you can shut me up with threats?!"

 dungeon_ongoing.0004.t:0 "Infection"
 dungeon_ongoing.0004.desc:0 "I thought the wound was almost healed, but now it has started burning. I cannot look at it properly in the dark, but it feels bulbous to the touch.\n\nI cannot tell if the moistness accompanying the searing pain is blood, pus, or condensation from the dank air."
 dungeon_ongoing.0004.a:0 "Please, I need help..."
 dungeon_no_response_tooltip:0 "#F No one seems to hear your pleas.#!"

 dungeon_ongoing.0009.desc:0 "I do not know how I would have survived down here without the comfort that my dear [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] provides.\n\nWhenever I feel sad it is there to comfort me, whenever I feel like giving up it urges me on.

 dungeon_ongoing.0010.t: "My Lifeline"
 dungeon_ongoing.0010.desc: "Perhaps my entombment is not set in stone. I could write to [letter_recipient.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)], imploring [letter_recipient.GetHerHim] to remove me from my hewn rock fate. But could I deliver a letter to [letter_recipient.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip] under so many prying eyes?"
 dungeon_ongoing.0010.a: "The guards themselves will assist me."
 dungeon_ongoing.0010.a.tt: "I must persuade [imprisoner.GetShortUINamePossessiveNoTooltip] guards to deliver my letter."

 dungeon_ongoing.0011.desc: "I have received a letter from a most unlikely source, [prisoner.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)]. [prisoner.GetSheHe|U] tells the most gruesome details of [prisoner.GetHerHis] imprisonment by [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstName] and implores me to rescue [prisoner.GetHerHim] at once, lest [prisoner.GetSheHe] fear death."
 dungeon_ongoing.0011.a: "[prisoner.GetSheHe|U] cannot stay a moment longer in that place!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0011.a.tt: "I will implore [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] to release [prisoner.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]"

 dungeon_ongoing.0012.t: "Burnt Letters"
 dungeon_ongoing.0012.desc: "The days yawn before me with no response from [letter_recipient.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)]. Where has [letter_recipient.GetSheHe] gone? Why has [letter_recipient.GetSheHe] not responded? If only I were free from this stone coil!"
 dungeon_ongoing.0012.a: "Maybe the letter was lost?"
 dungeon_ongoing.0012.b: "I always knew [letter_recipient.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] was a [letter_recipient.Custom('InsultNoun').]"

 dungeon_ongoing.0013.t: "Family Entombed"
 dungeon_ongoing.0013.desc_intro: "Though [prisoner.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] is my rightful prisoner, evidently [letter_recipient.GetTitledFirstName] cannot agree with my vision.\n\n"
 dungeon_ongoing.0013.desc_reasoning_compassionate: ""Do you not feel for a fellow [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetBaseName] being locked up like so?" [letter_recipient.GetSheHe] asks. "Look past [prisoner.GetHerHis] transgressions and think of the good of the house, I implore you.""
 dungeon_ongoing.0013.desc_reasoning_other: ""We are only weaker to outside threats when we are locked behind our own walls," [letter_recipient.GetSheHe] protests. "Will you not release [prisoner.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], then, for the good of [realm_title.GetNameNoTier]?""
 dungeon_ongoing.0013.a: "[prisoner.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] will go free today."
 dungeon_ongoing.0013.b: "[prisoner.GetSheHe|U] is my rightful prisoner, family be damned."

 dungeon_ongoing.0014.t: "Empty Echoes"
 dungeon_ongoing.0014.desc: "The guards' whispers reach me. [letter_recipient.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] has evidently heeded my letters and approached my jailer [imprisoner.GetTitledFirstName]. Unfortunately, the [imprisoner.Custom('InsultNoun')] has hardened [imprisoner.GetHerHis] heart and turned [letter_recipient.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] away. I am left no freer a [prisoner.GetWomanMan] than before."
 dungeon_ongoing.0014.a: "At least [letter_recipient.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] is a good [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', letter_recipient)] to me."
 dungeon_ongoing.0014.b: "Will no-one help me?!"
 

 dungeon_ongoing.9001.t:0 "Inside"
 dungeon_ongoing.9001.desc:0 "I do not recall the last time I saw the sun. I do not recall the last time I had solid food, or solid anything else.\n\nIt feels like the dampness in the air has fastened itself in my lungs.\n\nIf a tooth hurts, I simply pull it out of my rotting gums."
 dungeon_ongoing.9001.a:0 "It is so hard to move."

 dungeon_ongoing.9002.t:0 "Hollow"
 dungeon_ongoing.9002.desc:0 "The coughing never ends. It has been days, and I have not had an hour's sleep without waking with my hands clawing at my throat.\n\nLicking trickles of water off the wall does nothing anymore."

 dungeon_ongoing.9003.t:0 "Recollection"
 dungeon_ongoing.9003.desc:0 "Will I ever be let out of here? Am I simply locked up, abandoned and forgotten?\n\nDoes anyone but the jailer know I am here?\n\nIs there anyone left who knows my name?\n\nWho knows who I was?"
 dungeon_ongoing.9003.a:0 "I can barely recall their faces..."

 dungeon_ongoing.9004.t:0 "Abandonment"
 dungeon_ongoing.9004.desc:0 "I will die here. I know it for certain. I will never again feel the sun on my face, or hear laughter not tinged with an edge of hopelessness."

 dungeon_ongoing.9005.t:0 "Unfathomable Loss"
 dungeon_ongoing.9005.desc:0 "My faithful companion, my most treasured friend, my lifeline in this dark place...\n\nAs I cradle my dying [ROOT.Char.Custom('prison_pet')] in my arms I am overcome with the hopelessness of my situation. If even so pure a being as [dummy_gender.GetSheHe] must die in this place, what chance do I stand?"
 dungeon_ongoing.9005.a:0 "You cannot leave me here alone!"
