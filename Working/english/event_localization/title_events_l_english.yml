 title_event_francia_name_change.desc:0 "The reign of the Karling dynasty has come to an end!\n\nThe [francia_title.GetName] has finally slipped from their grasp. With the Karlings removed, these lands are truly no longer a part of their old empire.\n\nWith me as the future [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], we have a new and bright destiny ahead of us. It is, therefore, only fitting to remove #EMP any and all#! reminders of their influence. Including the very #EMP name#! itself!"

 title_event.0012.t:0 "Splitting the Crown"
 title_event.0012.desc:0 "With the creation of the [castille.GetName], and the throne of old [asturias.GetBaseNameNoTier] vacant, the Kingdom of Pelagius has finally been outgrown. Its rump shall forever be known as [leon.GetBaseNameNoTier], at least till that too is eclipsed by the rise of [castille.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip]."
 title_event.0012.a:0 "As it should be."

 title_event.0013.t:0 "$title_event.0012.t$"
 title_event.0013.desc:0 "Now that I hold the thrones of both [asturias.GetBaseNameNoTier] and a distinct [castille.GetBaseNameNoTier], the idea of a unified [asturias.GetNameNoTooltip] is considered both a little confusing and somewhat redundant by many.\n\nInstead, nobles and commoners alike have begun referring to the westerly half of my lands by alluding to the dominant inland portion, [leon.GetBaseNameNoTier]."
 title_event.0013.a:0 "Two crowns are better than one!"

 title_event.0014.t:0 "$title_event.0012.t$"
 title_event.0014.desc:0 "The recent formation of an independent [castille.GetBaseName], ruled by [castille_char.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction' leon_char)], has shattered my realm's claim to be the [asturias.GetBaseName].\n\nWith our eastern lands firmly lost to us, we are dominated by the inland area of [leon.GetBaseNameNoTier], and folk of every class and sect are letting the old title fall by the wayside."
 title_event.0014.a:0 "Splitters!"
 title_event.0014.b:0 "We'll get those lands back some day..."
 title_event.0014.c:0 "Huzzah! A whole #EMP kingdom#! of comrades!"

 title_event.0015.t:0 "$title_event.0012.t$"
 title_event.0015.desc:0 "With the recent creation of the [castille.GetBaseName], [leon_char.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', castille_char)] can no longer be said to truly rule a united [asturias.GetBaseNameNoTier].\n\nWithout the balancing force of my lands in the east, the former-[asturias.GetBaseNameNoTierNoTooltip] is really little more than a [leon.GetBaseName]. Peasantry, clergy, and even nobles alike have all begun referring to it as such, much to my chagrin."
 title_event.0015.a:0 "Power is back where it should always have been."
 title_event.0015.b:0 "Today, Castille. Tomorrow, #EMP Leon#!."
 title_event.0015.c:0 "We may be divided in rule, but we're united by blood!"
