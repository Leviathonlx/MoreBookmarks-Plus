 #Innovating with weaponry
 martial_authority.4000.t:0 "A Rusty Tool"
 martial_authority.4000.desc:0 "Peering through the dusty murk of the armory, my gaze travels over multiple different weapons of war. A pair of battered leather greaves, a recently-sharpened sword, a spear with a worn haft, a... #EMP rusty farming tool?#!\n\nI pick up the farming implement; perhaps it has been lumped in unknowingly with the weapons? I heft the tool, examining its curiously curved sickle-like blade, as I give it an experimental swing at a nearby hauberk.\n\nThe blade pierces the mail, scattering a few iron rings across the floor.\n\n#EMP Interesting.#!"
 martial_authority.4000.a:0 "I wonder if this could be repurposed?"
 martial_authority.4000.b:0 "That's enough of that."
 martial_authority.4000.a.tt:0 "You investigate ways to turn this tool into a weapon."
 martial_authority.4000.b.tt:0 "You search for other ways to hone your martial skill."

 martial_authority.4001.t:0 "A Rusty Tool: Choices, Choices..."
 martial_authority.4001.desc:0 "Taking the small blade out into the midday sun, I inspect it more closely. The blade tapers to a point at one end and disappears into the tang at the other, leaving a length of slightly rusty — but still sharp — iron in-between.\n\nThe kink at the blade's head gives the implement a wicked curve to it. Useful for cutting through shrubs, you'd think. Or maybe finding gaps in armor?\n\nIt's clear this could be repurposed as a weapon of war, but the question remains exactly what guise said weapon would take..."
 martial_authority.4001.a:0 "If you straightened out the blade, it could be a useful dagger..."
 martial_authority.4001.a.tt:0 "You attempt to fashion the tool into a short stabbing weapon."
 martial_authority.4001.b:0 "Perhaps if we mounted it on the end of a spear?"
 martial_authority.4001.b.tt:0 "You head back inside, searching for a length of cord..."
 martial_authority.4001.c:0 "Why don't we just leave it as-is?"
 martial_authority.4001.c.tt:0 "Perhaps this can be an effective weapon without modification?"
 martial_authority.4001.b.failure:0 "You broke the tool!"
 martial_authority_4001.dagger.tt:0 "You fashion a rudimentary dagger from the tool."
 martial_authority_4001.halberd.tt:0 "You fashion a rudimentary halberd from the tool."
 martial_authority_4001.billhook.tt:0 "You hone the blade."
 martial_authority_4001.fail.tt:0 "You fail to make anything useful of the implement."

 martial_authority.4002.t:0 "A Rusty Tool: The Jury-Rigged Blade"
 martial_authority.4002.desc:0 "As a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U], I'm not exactly well-versed with the process of actually modifying a weapon of war. Despite my enthusiasm, it quickly became clear that I'll need some expert guidance.\n\nI call the holding's somewhat harassed-looking blacksmith [blacksmith.GetFirstName] — who muttered something I didn't quite catch about rulers and their pet projects — and after a day or so of filing and honing my work is complete.\n\nThe formerly curved blade has been straightened out, its shortened blade leading to a tapering point, with a beveled groove running down the flat of the blade. It is not a pretty weapon: but a weapon it is nonetheless."
 martial_authority.4002.a:0 "It's perfect!"
 martial_authority.4002.b:0 "It's even better than my one!"

 martial_authority.4003.t:0 "A Rusty Tool: The Improvised Halberd"
 martial_authority.4003.desc:0 "Bracing the spear I had seen earlier between my leg and a table, I loop some rough twine around the farming tool and the spearhead, binding the two together. The head wobbles alarmingly at first, but the next day's application of some boiled leather strips — courtesy of the holding's tanner [blacksmith.GetFirstName] — finishes the modification.\n\nThe weapon I've created certainly looks the part. The size of the spear provides reach and thrust, whilst the farming implement's hooked blade could easily pull a man off a horse or tease its way into armor seams.\n\nIt's a rough-and-ready weapon, but I have the feeling it could be #EMP quite#! effective..."
 martial_authority.4003.a:0 "Let's see your fancy armor stand up to this!"
 martial_authority.4003.b:0 "It's even better than my one!"
 martial_authority_4003.make.tt:0 "You gain [improvised_halberd.GetName]"

 martial_authority.4004.t:0 "A Rusty Tool: Perfect The Way It Is"
 martial_authority.4004.desc:0 "The implement — which the holding's blacksmith [blacksmith.GetFirstName] explained to me is known as a 'billhook', as I enthusiastically supervised [blacksmith.GetHerHim] sharpening it — certainly looks the part as a weapon of war.\n\nThe blade emerges from the tang with a vicious edge to it, running up and through the weighty hooked head. The newly-sharpened point glints in the midday sun as I work it into the seam of some defunct boiled leather armor before ripping it back towards me, severing the holding loops in a single swing."
 martial_authority.4004.a:0 "What other secrets do our humble farmers hold?"
 martial_authority.4004.b:0 "I like these; distribute them through the realm!"
