# Forming Outremer, by Flavio Verna

 middle_east_decisions.0001.desc:0 "Since the rise of Muhammad, the Muslim religion has been a force to be reckoned with throughout the East, and a looming threat for the worshipers of Christ. Yet, thanks to my efforts to secure the Holy Land, this is no longer the case. \n\nI have pushed the infidels from the Mediterranean coasts and pursued them past the scorching deserts of Arabia. I have planted the holy cross of Our Lord from sea to sea, and forged a true Empire of Heaven over the broken Crescent of the false Prophet."

Yet, thanks to the efforts of [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] to secure the Holy Land, this is no longer the case. \n\nWith the blessing of [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.HighGodName], [scoped_ruler.GetFirstName] has pushed the infidels from the Mediterranean coasts and pursued them past the scorching deserts of Arabia. [scoped_ruler.GetSheHe|U] has planted the holy cross of Our Lord from sea to sea, and forged a true Empire of Heaven over the broken Crescent of the false Prophet."
 middle_east_decisions.0002.desc.muslims:0 "The barbarous hordes of Crusader [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] have brought ruin beyond comprehension upon the followers of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!\n\nThese vile idolaters have occupied all the sacred places of worship of our faith. Even the holy city of Mecca is now under the clutches of these blasphemous pigs. If the true followers of the Prophet do not reclaim Arabia soon, this might be the beginning of the end for Islam."

 middle_east_decisions.0003.desc:0 "Ever since the infidel occupation of the holy land, the true followers of the Prophet have been scattered to the four winds, without the leadership or will to resume the sacred struggle.\n\nThis ends today. By [reformer.GetFaith.HighGodNamePossessive] mercy, I have reclaimed Mecca and Medina and stopped the tide of infidels swarming Arabia. With the backing of several respected scholars of the book, I have been recognized as the new Caliph of [reformer.GetFaith.GetName], and I am ready to lead my followers against the wicked idolaters still polluting our homeland!"

# Creating Israel, by Flavio Verna

 middle_east_decisions.0005.desc:0 "With Jerusalem and the Promised Land under Jewish control, the time is ripe for the creation of a new United Monarchy named Israel — like the great kingdom of ancient times under David and Solomon.\n\nThe long-suffering Jewish people are finally in control of their own destiny again. No longer shall the Holy Land be torn asunder by warring Christian and Muslim lords. May this new kingdom usher in an era of peace and prosperity for the region!"

# Restore Jewish High Priesthood, by Flavio Verna
 middle_east_decisions.0007.t:0 "The New [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.GetAdjective] Priesthood"
 middle_east_decisions.0007.desc.intro:0 "There has not been a Kohen – a High Priest of Judaism — since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple roughly a thousand years ago. At long last, this position has been filled, and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\n"
 middle_east_decisions.0007.desc.me:0 "As an influential and pious leader of Jewish people, the priestly class have of course determined that I am the best candidate to lead the Jewish religion into a new era. Though I lack the traditional blood of Aaron required to be Kohen Gadol, priests and laymen alike celebrate my ordainment as head of the High Priesthood."
 middle_east_decisions.0007.desc.not_me:0 "Like the Jewish priests of ancient times, the Kohen Gadol was traditionally required to be a descendant of Aaron, the older brother of Moses. Due to a lack of suitable candidates, this requirement has been waived, but the new High Priest still enjoys the respect of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] religious communities."

# Restore Zoroastrian High Priesthood, by Flavio Verna
 middle_east_decisions.0009.t:0 "The New [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.GetAdjective] Priesthood"
 middle_east_decisions.0009.desc:0 "After the interlude of exile and persecution following the Arab conquests, Zoroastrianism has been accepted by the people of Persia as the one true path to righteousness. [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] has ordered the institution of the office of the [new_priest.GetTitleTierName], a Priest of Priests to rule over a restored clerical hierarchy.\n\nThe [new_priest.GetTitleTierName] will serve as the highest religious authority in the [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.GetAdjective] world, with powers ranging from the blessing of future military expeditions to the granting of divorces to married couples."
 middle_east_decisions.0009.a:0 "The eternal flame burns once more!"
 middle_east_decisions.0010.desc.muslims:0 "The accursed followers of [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.HighGodName] have reclaimed enough land and influence to re-establish a blasphemous priesthood under the protection of [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nIf not soon stopped, these demon-worshiping pagans might turn the tide of Islamic expansion in Persia, polluting the mind of their unaware subjects with lies and perversions."
 middle_east_decisions.0010.desc.others:0 "The strange, fire-worshiping followers of [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.HighGodName] have reclaimed enough of their ancestral Persian territories to re-establish a functional Priesthood.\n\nIf not stopped soon, they might turn the tide of Islamic expansion and restore Asia under the protection of their old gods."
 middle_east_decisions.0010.a:0 "Glory to [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
 middle_east_decisions.0010.b:0 "Their demons will not shield them from the might of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"

# The Saoyshant appears, by Flavio Verna
 middle_east_decisions.0011.t:0 "The Chosen of Zoroaster"
 middle_east_decisions.0011.desc:0 "Ever since the Sassanid Empire succumbed to the Arab invasions, Persia has suffered under the yoke of Mohammedan rulers. The last remnants of the old Zoroastrian order retreated north into the plains of Central Asia, but now, at long last, Zoroastrian rule over Persia has been restored.\n\nThis miraculous recovery can only be attributed to my brilliant leadership, and many amongst the clergy have decreed me to be the Saoshyant — the savior of the world that Zoroaster himself spoke of thousands of years ago. After embracing this role, I am now revered as a holy icon by Zoroastrians everywhere."
 middle_east_decisions.0011.a:0 "I shall bring benefit to all."

 middle_east_decisions.0013.desc.muslims:0 "Once reduced to exiled desert-dwellers, the fire-priests of the accursed blasphemer Zoroaster have risen from their cinders and claimed the throne of Persia!\n\nFilled with deranged pride, their [scoped_ruler.GetTitleTierName] has now decided to proclaim [scoped_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] a living god."
 middle_east_decisions.0013.desc.others:0 "Ever since the Sassanid Empire succumbed to the Arab invasions, the followers of Zoroaster have been on the run. Their exile has come to an end in recent times as the [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faithful have managed to restore their ancient Empire.\n\nBeing in no small part responsible for this unexpected turn of events, their [scoped_ruler.GetTitleTierName] has decided to proclaim [scoped_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] Saoshyant, the prophesied savior of their creed."

# Create Sultanate of Rum, by Flavio Verna
 middle_east_decisions.0014.t:0 "A New Rome"
 middle_east_decisions.0014.desc:0 "With the conquest of the rich lands of Asia Minor, I have accumulated enough power to form a new Sultanate, one that is sure to top the greatness of Rome itself.\n\nThere is still work to be done, yet I have no doubt historians will enshrine this moment as one of the great steps in the conquest of Europe by the followers of [scoped_ruler.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 middle_east_decisions.0014.a:0 "Let the West quake!"
 middle_east_decisions.0015.desc.liege:0 "After a series of victories in Anatolia, [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to crown [scoped_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] [scoped_ruler.GetTitleTierName] of Rum, claiming that [scoped_ruler.GetSheHe] no longer holds any allegiance to me and will pursue the fight against the infidels on [scoped_ruler.GetHerHis] own terms."
 middle_east_decisions.0015.desc.romans:0 "The savage warlord [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName] has carved [scoped_ruler.GetHerHis] path through Anatolia and established a new Sultanate in the region.\n\nAs if this was not enough of an insult, in a despicable show of hubris, [scoped_ruler.GetSheHe] has decided to claim for [scoped_ruler.GetHerselfHimself] the title of [scoped_ruler.GetTitleTierName] of Rome."
 middle_east_decisions.0015.desc.others:0 "The rich province of Asia Minor, once a bastion for Christianity, has now fallen under the rule of [scoped_ruler.GetTitledFirstName], who has formed a new Sultanate in the region."

 # Revive the Armenian Empire, by Ewan Cowhig Croft
 middle_east_decisions.1001.t:0 "A New Eagle Rises"
 middle_east_decisions.1001.desc:0 "It has been centuries since Armenia last exerted this level of dominance in the Levant and the Caucasus, the twin empires of East and West beating us bloody time and again. Sometimes the West speaks Latin, sometimes Greek, and sometimes the East speaks Persian, sometimes Arabic, but always these empires fight, and always our ancient lands seem to be the battleground.\n\nAfter today, no more. I have carved anew the old territories of Tigranes the Great, and the eagle-standard of Greater Armenia rises again!"
 middle_east_decisions.1001.a:0 "I shall go on to greater things still!"
 middle_east_decisions.1001.b:0 "No less an accomplishment for being repetitious."
 middle_east_decisions.1002.desc:0 "A strange situation has been brewing in the mountains of the Caucasus for some time. Against all odds, [founder.GetFullNameNoTooltip] has succeeded in carving a sizable realm, spreading from the Caspian Sea in the east to the shores of the Mediterranean in the west. Though imperfect, this has roughly recreated the long-dead empire of Tigranes the Great, a circumstance that the heralds of [founder.GetFullNameNoTooltip] are quick to trumpet.\n\nThe eagle-standard of Greater Armenia rises again, but for how long?"
 middle_east_decisions.1002.a:0 "Imperial dignity requires more than mere land."
 middle_east_decisions.1002.b:0 "This time, none shall tear us asunder."
 middle_east_decisions.1002.c:0 "As much a footnote as its predecessor."
