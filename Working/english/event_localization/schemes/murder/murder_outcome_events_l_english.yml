 murder_outcome.5002.infant_creepy_crawly:0 "A soft blanket beneath me, and a warm cover. I am almost falling asleep when I feel a curious sensation, as if something is moving up my body.

 # Hired an Assassin
 murder_outcome_reworked.0001.desc.assassin_present_at_location.consort: "[assassin.GetFirstName], as [target.GetHerHis] [assassin.Custom2('GetYourConsortType', target)], was of course already in place: all [assassin.GetSheHe] had to do was wait for [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to fall asleep, draw the knife provided out from under [assassin.GetHerHis] pillow, and slash the [target.Custom('InsultNoun')]'s throat. A rope tossed from the window, a few self-inflicted cuts, and signs of a scuffle pre-prepared below faked the "true" killer's escape rather well."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0001.desc.hired_assassin.assassin_present_at_location: "[assassin.GetFirstName] executed our plan perfectly. In the dead of night, [assassin.GetSheHe] snuck through a gap in the roaming patrols, let [assassin.GetHerselfHimself] into our quarry's chambers with a stolen key, and brought [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] wretched existence to a wet, gurgling end."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0001.desc.hired_assassin.assassin_remote_working: "[assassin.GetFirstNamePossessive] hireling executed our plan perfectly. In the dead of night, the [dummy_assassin_gender.GetWomanMan] snuck through a gap scouted in the roaming patrols, let [dummy_assassin_gender.GetHerselfHimself] into our quarry's chambers with a stolen key, and brought [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] wretched existence to a wet, gurgling end."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0002.desc: "$murder_outcome.5001.hired_assassin$"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0003.desc: "The assassin made a critical mistake at the most delicate moment! [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] woke up to see a meancing figure cloaked in darkness standing by [target.GetHerHis] bed and immediately screamed for help, sending our startled agent into a hasty flight."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0004.desc: "Noises of fumbling hands and hushed curses wake me up from my slumber.\n\nClose to me — #EMP too close for comfort#! — stands a figure cloaked in darkness, apparently as starled as me. My sudden scream for help sends it scurring, while my guards rush in."
 
 # Hired A Gang Of Thugs
 murder_outcome_reworked.0011.desc: "It didn't take much, really — just a gang of desperate bandits greedy for silver and an engineered opportunity for them to strike — but the results have been #EMP outstanding#!. The melee caught [target.GetHerHis] defenders completely off guard, allowing one of the cutthroats to get the bastard right through the eye."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0012.desc.alley: "My retinue and I are traveling through the backstreets of [target.GetCurrentLocation.GetName],"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0012.desc.wilderness: "My retinue and I are traveling through the wilds of [target.GetCurrentLocation.GetName],"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0012.desc: "when a bloodcurdling scream cuts through our ranks.\n\nSeemingly from nowhere, we are accosted by a band of rogues! Arrows and swords fly thick and fast, sheer ferocity and lust for death decimating my guards in the blink of an eye. Unwilling to let this ambush be my grave, I take flight, dashing for a safer spot. Then, over the noise of battle, I hear the pure twang of a single bowstring."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0013.desc: "Our plan seemed... so perfect... an engineered distraction, a mob of desperate bandits, and a sudden ambush. It #EMP should#! have been [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] grave, but [target.GetHerHis] damned fool guards threw themselves in front of every blow, bolt, or blade, rallied, and counter-attacked. Our hirelings fell in droves."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0014.desc: "when a bloodcurdling scream cuts through our ranks.\n\nSeemingly from nowhere, we are accosted by a band of rogues! Their assault is ferocious, but naught compared to the fury of my guards, and we surge out to meet them. A vicious melee ensues, with the cutthroats #EMP clearly#! targeting me most of all. Only a fool wouldn't recognize this for an assassination attempt."

 # Poisoning
 murder_outcome_reworked.0021.desc: "It took weeks to lay the foundations for my plan: a poisoned dish, fit for a [target.GetWomanMan] of [target.GetHerHis] stature. Ever the fool, [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] proved unable to smell the poison past the tainted duck's bed of exotic herbs. Clearly didn't notice the deadly bitterness till it was already far, far too late."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0022.desc: "I am enjoying a particularly fine roast duck at my feast when... what strange bitterness is this in the after taste? That fool cook must have —\n\nMy throat swells. Something thick and heavy bursts in my neck, clouding my vision with a pounding headache that sets upon my brow like a raging storm. Why... why does my vision cloud and darken so. Somewhere, a distant laugh morphs into a horrified scream. I cannot focus, #DIE1 I cannot think#!, #DIE2 I cannot...#!"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0023.desc: "#EMP Fool!#! How is it possible that there's always one of them to ruin even the most perfect of plans?!\n\nThe duck was ready to be served, the smell of poison artfully hidden by a bed of sweet-smelling herbs, the silence of the cooks generously bought... And yet a fool of a servant #EMP had#! to sneak a taste of the dish, just to promptly fall dead in front of [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0024.desc: "As I am about to bite into the most succulent piece of duck I have ever seen, one of my servants keels over, collapsing face-first onto the table and clutching at his throat. He had been helping himself to a taste of my meal!\n\nAt the very least he served as a warning to not touch the bird, while receiving just punishment for his crime."
 
 # Creepy-Crawly
 murder_outcome_reworked.0031.desc: "The plan worked like a charm: my precious [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreature')] was waiting for [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in [target.GetHerHis] bed when [target.GetSheHe] retired for the night, silent and ready to strike at the first provocation. And then [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] moved."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0033.desc: "The plan was, supposedly, fool-proof: a [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreature')] was waiting for [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in [target.GetHerHis] bed when [target.GetSheHe] retired for the night; [target.GetSheHe] only had to lie down and let the little creeper do its job! Instead, the [target.Custom('InsultNoun')] noticed the suspicious movement in the covers and killed the [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreatureType')] before it could strike."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0034.desc: "As I retire for the night, a suspicious movement among the covers on my bed attracts my attention. I pull the blankets back carefully so as not to startle any unwelcome guest, only to find a [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreatureType')] waiting for me!\n\n"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0034.desc_unknown: "I can't precisely identify the little creeper, but I doubt it's friendly."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0034.desc_end: "Without a moment of hesitation, I grab my dagger and stab the creature firmly into place."
 
 # Riled-Up Mob
 murder_outcome_reworked.0041.desc: "An agitated mob of angry peasants was waiting for [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] on [target.GetHerHis] way through town.\n\nThe mere sight of the [target.GetLadyLord] riding carelessly by was enough for them to explode into murderous violence. The few guards who accompanied their liege were powerless against the blind fury of a crowd craving blood; [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was trampled, beaten, and stabbed beyond recognition — beyond any chance of survival."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0042.desc: "I am all caught up in my thoughts as I ride through town, so I don't pay any attention to the nervous muttering of my guards or the growing crowd blocking our way. By the time I notice, it's too late.\n\nFurious peasants surround us, tear us from our horses, and beat us mercilessly. As relentless hits fall on me, too many to count, my sight is obfuscated by blood, then everything turns to black."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0043.desc: "Everything was going so well: my agitators had successfully collected a mob of peasants and adequately riled up their spirits against [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nHowever, when [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] made [target.GetHerHis] appearance surrounded by armed guards, the crowd's thirst for blood evaporated like snow in the sun! Only a few stragglers attacked, and they were quickly put down by the soldiers."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0044.desc: "As I ride through town with my retinue, I can't help but notice the growing mob surrounding us from every side.\n\nLuckily, this morning I decided to depart with a sizable group of well-armed soldiers, the sight of which is working wonders to cool down the crowd's discontent. When a small contingent of angry-looking peasants attempts to attack us, my guards cut them down with ease, dispersing the remaining ne'er-do-wells."
 
 # Bricked Up Alive
 murder_outcome_reworked.0051.desc: "The plan was elegant in its simplicity: I invited [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] over for drinks, knowing all too well that [target.GetSheHe] would not be able to stop until blindly drunk. Then, the fool followed me without protest into the basement and promtly fell asleep. [target.GetSheHe|U] didn't even stir as my servants built up a wall to seal the entrance to the room. #EMP Forever.#!"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0053.desc: "Everything was going according to plan: I invited [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] over for drinks, knowing all too well that [target.GetSheHe] would not be able to stop until blindly drunk. Then, the fool followed me without protest into the basement and promtly fell asleep. My servants were just meant to build a wall and seal [target.GetHerHim] inside, but apparently they got #EMP too tired#! and didn't finish the work, so [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] managed to escape!"
 
 # Sink A Boat They're On
 murder_outcome_reworked.0061.desc: "Ships sink all the time. It's a fact of life. Sometimes, they are #EMP helped#! to sink by some tampering, exactly when they are just a tiny bit too far from the coast. The cold embrace of the open sea is shocking, they tell me. I could ask [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], if [target.GetSheHe] hadn't drowned. A true #EMP tragedy#!."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0062.desc_port: "I find myself on board a local ship for a short supervising trip. The coast is still close in sight, and my mind is all absorbed by some report or another so I barely hear the sudden cracking noise and the screams of the sailors."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0062.desc_travel: "I love the open sea! The sun kissing my face, the wind sweeping my cloak around, the crisp smell of salt water filling my nose, the creepy cracking noises accompanied by frantic screams from the sailors— Wait, #EMP WHAT#!?!"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0062.desc: "\n\nI have no time to react as the broken mast falls on me, knocking all wind out of my lungs and tossing me overboard. The shock of the impact with the cold water does the rest, as my heavy clothes pull me down... under the waves..."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0063.desc: "Ships sink all the time. It's a fact of life. Or, at least, it #EMP should#! be! How hard is it to sabotage a piece of floating junk so it ends up under the waves, together with [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]?!\n\nApparently it was too hard for my accomplices, as [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] ship made it back safely with just a minor hiccup along the way. A clearly staged and potentially lethal hiccup."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0064.desc: "My ship is sailing peacefully in the setting sun when a cracking noise and the frantic screams of sailors attract my attention. In a moment, I find myself swept away by one of my guards as a part of the mast falls and stops exactly in front of me.\n\nThe damage to the ship is considerable, but the captain is confident we will make it back to the nearest port safely. And most importantly, no one was hurt."
 
 # Poisoned Drink
 murder_outcome_reworked.0071.desc: "My accomplices gained access to nothing less than [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] own goblet at [target.GetHerHis] last dinner! Unnoticed, they poured just a few droplets of a powerful poison in [target.GetHerHis] drink. The poor [target.Custom('InsultNoun')] downed the whole goblet in one gulp and was a goner before even realizing what was happening!"
 murder_outcome_reworked.0073.desc: "My accomplices managed to sneak a poisoned barrel into [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] kitchen, and prepared and served [target.GetHerHim] a full goblet of the tampered drink. The barrel idea was a mistake.\n\nBefore the [target.Custom('InsultNoun')] even brought the goblet to [target.GetHerHis] lips, servants burst into the room, announcing that someone else who had drunk from the same barrel had immediately died."
 murder_outcome_reworked.0074.desc: "I am enjoying dinner on an evening like any other. A delightful goblet filled to the brim sits in front of me, tantalizing. As I finally reach for it, a whole host of servants bursts into the room screaming. "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], stop! It's poisoned! One of us drank from the same barrel and promptly fell dead!" My hand freezes in mid-air."

 # Outcomes — Children

 # Left Child In Forest
 murder_outcome_reworked.4001.desc: "[target.GetSheHe|U] was so excited about [target.GetHerHis] trip to the forest! Sadly, everybody knows that forests are no place for children — so young, so #EMP naive#! — it's so easy for them to be swept away by their enthusiasm and lose their orientation, their guardians, and their way home. They never return. Just like little [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. What a tragedy."
 murder_outcome_reworked.4003.desc: "It was supposed to be so easy! Forests are no place for children: dark, dangerous, full of ravines, poisonous plants, and flesh-hungry beasts! How difficult is it for a child to just get lost and die?!\n\nApparently it was too difficult for [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], as the little bugger had the #EMP audacity#! to find [target.GetHerHis] way back home safe and sound!"
 
 # Infant Stabbed To Death
 murder_outcome_reworked.4011.desc: "Children are such fragile creatures... Any sickness could steal them away from their family. Or any accident! Like those involving delicate little heads and sharp needles — I didn't need nor want to hear the details, as long as the job was done. So gruesome, such a #EMP disgrace#!."
 murder_outcome_reworked.4013.desc: "People have so many qualms when it comes to children. My accomplices all agreed that [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] had to go, they were paid generously to make it happen, and yet they hesitated at the mere sight of the baby sleeping peacefully! It was so easy, just a sharp stab where the head is softest, and it would have been over... Such a wasted occasion."
 
 # Infant Bitten By Creepy Crawly
 murder_outcome_reworked.4021.desc: "People are weird. It is hard to find one willing to raise a hand against an infant, but to place a [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreature')] in a cradle is, apparently, much more acceptable. The [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreatureType')], on its side, had no particular qualms either and struck true. The poison played its part quickly and mercilessly."
 murder_outcome_reworked.4023.desc: "The [SCOPE.Custom('VenomousCreature')] was delivered to [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] bed as planned but, apparently, the infant's movements startled it into hiding rather than attacking. The useless creature was found some hours later by a servant, hiding under a cupboard. The damned baby was left unscathed."
 murder_outcome_reworked.4024.desc: "A soft bed beneath me and a warm blanket covering me are all I desire. I am almost unconscious when I vaguely feel a curious sensation, as if something is moving up my body. I turn sharply to my side and the sensation is gone. I fall asleep.\n\nLater on, I'm awoken by the shrill screams of a servant. I'm not sure of what is happening: a lot of adults are running around, their strong voices booming, and many point at something I can't see under a cupboard."
 
 # Poisoned Candy
 murder_outcome_reworked.4031.desc: "Children are so gullible! I just had to disuise one of my accomplices as a servant, have him bring a piece of delicious-looking, absolutely poisoned cake to [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], and the little fool just gulped it down in one huge bite, no questions asked!\n\nPerhaps we should start teaching kids not to accept candy from strangers..."
 murder_outcome_reworked.4033.desc: "Damn children and their unpredictability! It was supposed to be so easy: sneak a poisoned but irresistable treat to [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], and [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] dies. What kind of child responds "I'm not hungry" when offered a #EMP treats?#!"
 murder_outcome_reworked.4034.desc: "I am out playing, feeling a bit thirsty, when a servant appears out of nowhere offering me a [ROOT.Char.Custom('FavoriteTreat')]. But I don't want a [ROOT.Char.Custom('FavoriteTreat')], I want to drink! Silly servant!\n\nI have already forgotten everything about the incident when several servants approach me, hours later, congratulating me for being so smart and brave and foiling some evil plan or something. Whatever. I do want a [ROOT.Char.Custom('FavoriteTreat')] now, though!"
 
 # Child Pushed To Death
 murder_outcome_reworked.4041.desc: "All things fall eventually: kingdoms, [ROOT.Char.Custom('LadiesLords')], #EMP children pushed from high places#!...\n\nSuch an unavoidable tragedy."
 murder_outcome_reworked.4043.desc: "As my agent pushed [target.GetHerHim] over the edge, [target.GetHerHis] clothing snagged on a protruding piece of wall just below. It held [target.GetHerHim] long enough for help to arrive to save both the child and"

 # Outcomes — Prison

 # Beaten To Death In Prison
 murder_outcome_reworked.7001.desc: "One certainty of life is that jailors only care about who is allowed to leave their prison, and hardly about who gets in or what happens to them.\n\nWhen my accomplices offered them a generous bribe to be allowed to visit their #EMP good friend#! [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], they were only too eager to accept. Being deaf to the screams and cracking bones was just part of the service."
 murder_outcome_reworked.7003.desc: "$murder_outcome_reworked.7001.desc$ Then why did they have to intervene before the job was concluded?!"
 murder_outcome_reworked.7004.desc: "$murder_outcome.5001.beat_to_death_in_dungeon$ Then, my usual jailors break in, and the beating stops."
 
 # Unwelcome Guest - House Arrest
 murder_outcome_reworked.7011.desc: "Prisoners under house arrest are supposed to be watched closely; therefore, sneaking one of my agents into [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] home under the guise of visiting an old friend was a true strike of genius, if I may say so myself! My accomplice was in and out before the guards even knew that something was wrong."
 murder_outcome_reworked.7012.desc: "My guards have introduced an unfamiliar hooded figure into my room as an old friend of mine. I'm about to protest that there must have been a mistake, as I clearly don't know this person, when a shiny dagger appears from a hidden pocket. #EMP Oh.#! It's one of #EMP those#! old friends.\n\nI have no time to react as the dagger darts at me faster than an arrow, and I fall to the ground without making a sound."
 murder_outcome_reworked.7013.desc: "Prisoners under house arrest are supposed to be watched closely; therefore, sneaking one of my agents into [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] home under the guise of visiting an old friend was supposed to be a true strike of genius! Sadly, the guards didn't really buy my accomplice's story and waited just outside the room, ready to intervene in case of any suspicious business. Apparently, attempted murder #EMP does#! count as #EMP suspicious business#!."

 # Strangling Incapable
 murder_outcome_reworked.8001.desc: "[target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] days of glory have long been behind [target.GetHerHim]. Yet [target.GetSheHe] clinged to life so long, so desperately, so #EMP vainly#!... I believe that what my agent did was nothing more than an act of mercy. [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was just an empty shell. Is that really even murder?"
 murder_outcome_reworked.8003.desc: "It is outrageous how wildly incompetent an agent can be. How hard can it be to strangle a fragile person whose mind is not present anymore and who is barely alive at all?! And yet, I am only met with failure."
