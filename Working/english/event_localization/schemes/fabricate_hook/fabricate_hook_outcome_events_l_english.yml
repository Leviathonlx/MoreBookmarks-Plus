 fabricate_hook_outcome.1001.desc:0 "Everyone gets naked #EMP sometime.#! The hard part is ensuring that the troop of jugglers enter [target.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] chambers at just the right time, and that there are enough servants around to speculate about the ensuing chaos.\n\nI suspect [target.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will do anything to prevent me from stoking the flames of the following rumors..."

 fabricate_hook_outcome.1003.desc:0 "Would it not be wonderful if [target.GetTitledFirstName] owed me, not out of fear, but out of gratitude? If I, for example, were to save [target.GetHerHim] from vicious bandits while [target.GetSheHe] was out traveling?
