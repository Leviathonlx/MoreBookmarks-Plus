 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0001.desc:0 "I want [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] to like me more, and who doesn't like a gift?"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0001.a:0 "[target.GetSheHe|U] will be mightily impressed by this one!"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0001.b:0 "Considering our relationship, it's prudent to show restraint."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0001.c:0 "A gift is not the way to go."

 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0002.t:0 "Befriend: In the Face of Unfriendliness"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0002.desc:0 "[target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)|U] keeps shunning my efforts to befriend [target.GetHerHim].\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] has made it clear that [target.GetSheHe] thinks [target.GetSheHe] will never ever consider me highly. Or even just better than an earthworm."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0002.a:0 "This is difficult..."
 
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0003.t:0 "Befriend: The Value of Insistence"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0003.desc:0 "The letters and gifts I worried about all seem to have reached [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] because [target.GetSheHe] has finally responded!\n\nIt was to say that my insistence is bothering [target.GetHerHim], however."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0003.a:0 "At least I'm making an impression!"
 
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0004.t:0 "Befriend: Return to Sender"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0004.desc:1 "It seems a few of the friendly letters I sent to [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] have been returned with my messenger, unopened.\n\nHow does [target.GetSheHe] not understand that I am only trying to make things better?"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0004.a:0 "I just want [target.GetHerHim] to like me."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0004.b:0 "I will have a herald deliver my words in person!"
 
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0005.t:0 "Befriend: A Softening Disposition"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0005.desc:0 "My attempts to improve my standing in the eyes of [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] have certainly faced challenges, but my couriers have reported that my letters are no longer received with the same grunts of disappointment.\n\n[target.GetHerHis|U] face now occasionally displays something that might be... interest."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.0005.a:0 "Hah, I'll get [target.GetHerHim] yet!"
 
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2001.t:0 "Befriend: Uninvited"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2001.desc:0 "[target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)|U] is well known as a gregarious and friendly [target.GetWomanMan], eager to feast and celebrate with others.\n\nYet [target.GetSheHe] has not invited me to [target.GetHerHis] latest feast at a baron's manor, even though it is quite close to my own lands, making me a natural guest!"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2001.a:0 "This is a grave insult!"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2001.b:0 "A missed opportunity, but I can't afford to read into it."
 
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2002.t:0 "Befriend: Getting Close"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2002.desc:0 "It is well-known that [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] is quite shy, rarely eager to spend more time with people than [target.GetSheHe] deem necessary.\n\nNow [target.GetSheHe] has stopped responding to my communiques, and I am unsure of how to proceed."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2002.a:0 "I must give [target.GetHerHim] time."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.2002.b:0 "I'll make sure [target.GetHerHim] hears from me. A lot!"
 
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5001.t:0 "Befriend: A Cynic and a Zealot"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5001.desc:0 "My efforts to ease the tension between [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] and myself are hindered by [target.GetHerHis] senseless obsession with my lack of piety. \n\nYet, for all [target.GetHerHis] complaints, [target.GetTitledFirstName] still fails to explain why it is worth caring more about [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetFaith.HighGodName] than I already do, of course."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5001.a:0 "I suppose I could visit the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HouseOfWorship] more often."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5001.b:0 "We will just have to manage."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5001.c:0 "Who cares about the doubts I harbor anyways!"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5002.t:0 "Befriend: Trust and Distrust"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5002.desc:0 "It would be a lot easier to make [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] like me more if [target.GetSheHe] just believed the honesty of my attempt! Instead, [target.GetSheHe] sneers at me, and wonders what I am hoping to gain from my kindness."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5002.a:0 "I will be insistent, but not lie about who I am."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5002.b:0 "Um, yes, maybe I am trying to gain something..."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5003.t:0 "Befriend: Feeling Down"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5003.desc:0 "All I want is to make [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] see the joy of being around other people! However, [target.GetSheHe] seems to always keep to [target.GetHerselfHimself] and to rarely want to leave [target.GetHerHis] room, unless absolutely necessary."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5003.a:0 "[target.GetSheHe|U] should just get over it already!"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5003.b:0 "If [target.GetSheHe] needs space, I will give it to [target.GetHerHim]."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5004.t:0 "Befriend: Wondrous Gift Disappoints"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5004.desc:0 "I wished to show my good intentions to [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] by having a grandiose banquet prepared and sent to [target.GetHerHis] [target.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], yet I just heard the news that [target.GetSheHe] has supposedly not had even the smallest portion of it all!\n\n I thought something might be wrong, but apparently, it's just that not everyone enjoys mountains of food as much as I do."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5004.a:0 "I will apologize for my excesses."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5004.b:0 "[target.GetSheHe|U] can watch [target.GetHerHis] food rot, then."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5005.t:0 "Befriend: Call to Action"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5005.desc:0 "I am trying to make [target.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroductionNoComma', ROOT.Char)] understand me better, but all it has resulted in is me understanding [target.GetHerHim] less and less. Where is [target.GetHerHis] drive, [target.GetHerHis] ambition? It seems as if [target.GetSheHe] wouldn't care if things stayed exactly the way they are now."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5005.a:0 "I'll try to settle for this as it is for now, then."
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5005.b:0 "Is a person like that even worth knowing?"
 befriend_ongoing_dislike.5005.c:0 "What kind of ambitions are they tending in secret?!"
