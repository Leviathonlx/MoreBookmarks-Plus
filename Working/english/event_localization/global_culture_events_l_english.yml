 # Visigoth Split
 global_culture.0002.t:0 "Fate of the Visigoths"
 global_culture.0002.desc:0 "Long ago, our ancestors migrated to the Iberian peninsula and built their first settlements. We have lived here for generations since then, the land shaping us as much as we have shaped the land.\n\nIt is time to ask ourselves, are we still Visigoths? Or are we something new entirely?"
 global_culture.0002.a:0 "The times are changing, and we must change with them."
 global_culture.0002.b:0 "We will not abandon the traditions of our ancestors!"

 global_culture.0005.desc:0 "When the Visigoths first migrated into the Iberian peninsula, they were foreigners in a new and strange land.\n\nThis changed over many generations, as land shaped them as much as they shaped the land itself. Over time the various communities of Visigoths grew distinct and separate from one another.\n\nDespite their shared heritage these new communities — [castilian.GetName], [catalan.GetName], [occitan.GetName], and [andalusian.GetName] — no longer recognize each other as kin."

 global_culture.0012.a:0 "We must ensure our own prosperity first and foremost."
 global_culture.0012.b:0 "Unacceptable! The Norse #EMP will#! stay united."

 global_culture.0015.desc:0 "Traders, raiders, and mercenaries... the Norse have long traveled from Scandinavia all throughout Europe and even beyond, leaving their mark everywhere they went.\n\nNow it appears that this age may be coming to an end, as cultural differences and clan rivalries have led to the rise of disparate [danish.GetName], [swedish.GetName], and [norwegian.GetName] identities amongst them."
 global_culture.0015.desc_norse:0 "Traders, raiders, and mercenaries... our Norse ancestors have long traveled from Scandinavia all throughout Europe and even beyond, leaving their mark everywhere they went.\n\nNow it appears that this age may be coming to an end, as our motherland is fractured by cultural differences and clan rivalries into [danish.GetName], [swedish.GetName], and [norwegian.GetName] identities."
 global_culture.0015.a:0 "What does this mean for the future of Europe?"
