I ask.\n\n"It is [ascetic.GetName], my liege. [ascetic.GetSheHe|U] has taken to scaling a pillar in the palace courtyard in the morning, and remaining there all day in quiet contemplation. [ascetic.GetSheHe] refuses food and drink, and says relatively little when questioned. Ascetic practices like these aren't unheard of, but it's bothering some of your court and they're asking me to do something about it.""

 court.7050.desc:0 "As the business of the court continues, I was much pleased to see the face of my friend [friend.GetName] amongst the dozens of schemers and sycophants. I greeted [friend.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] warmly, and conversed freely with [friend.GetHerHim] as I am able to do with so few others. Halfway through our conversation, [friend.GetSheHe] produces a small pouch from inside [friend.GetHerHis] clothes, and places it in my hand. \n\n"A gift for you my friend, something for you to remember the good times. It is special to me, and to my people the [friend.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun]. I hope you will accept it.""

 court.7051.title:0 "Heretical Symbols?"
 court.7051.desc:0 "Ever since I received [court_7050_artifact.GetName] as a gift from [friend.GetName], I have kept it on my person. I assume it must have been noticed at court, for I have now been approached by [court_chaplain.GetCouncilTitle] [court_chaplain.GetName], who expresses [court_chaplain.GetHerHis] worry that I am being led from the true faith!\n\n"I have noticed that you have taken to displaying your affection for heretical symbols and objects, such things which are associated with heathen faiths. It is often said that [court_chaplain.GetFaith.DevilName] comes to us disguised as a friend, only to lead us astray.""
 court.7051.a:0 "I have been tricked by [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName]!"

### Court Event 7070 - Architect wishes to give your palace a makeover
 court.7070.title:0 "Palatial Potential"
 court.7070.desc:0 ""My liege, I have been discussing the current state of your palace in [palace_county.GetName] with your courtiers who have been guests there. As your $royal_architect_court_position$, I would be remiss in my duty if I did not inform you that your palace in [palace_county.GetName] is in dire need of renovation!" states [architect.GetName].\n\n"I wondered [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeAddress',architect)], whether we might also take the opportunity to drastically overhaul the entire decor and style of the palace, to perhaps move away from classical [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] architecture. All I need is funding and some time to draft some ideas," asks [architect.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 court.7070.a:0 "Excellent suggestion, you may draw up plans."
 court.7070.a.tt:0 "[architect.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will draw inspiration from other [cultures|E] when planning the palace renovation, presenting you with options that may raise [cultural_acceptance|E] towards other [cultures|E]."

 court.7070.c:0 "The palace is fine as it is!"
 court.7071.title:0 "Imitatio Architecture"
 court.7071.desc:0 "As promised, [architect.GetName] has returned to me with three detailed plans for the proposed renovation of the palace in [palace_county.GetName].\n\n"I have taken inspiration from [culture_option_1.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetCulture.GetName] styles for the first design, [culture_option_2.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetCulture.GetName] styles for the second design, and for the final plan I retained [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName] as the primary influence, [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeAddress',architect)]."\n\nFrom the looks of things, all three designs look to be very expensive and incorporate new additions as well as renovations of the existing structure - this is unlikely to be a quick or cheap job."
 court.7071.a:0 "Go with the [culture_option_1.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] design."
 court.7071.continue:0 "The project continues..."
 court.7071.b:0 "Let's use the [culture_option_2.GetProvince.GetCounty.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] design."
 court.7071.c:0 "This palace shall be a monument to [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] superiority!"
 court.7071.d:0 "This is too much, abort the project."

After surveying the palace with its unfamiliar styles and foreign decor, I declare it to be..."

As I gaze upon the new palace, and then head inside, [architect.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] remains at my side, eagerly expecting praise and patronage. After surveying the palace, with its familiar styles and reassuring decor, I declare it to be..."
 court.7072.a:0 ""Magnificent, truly magnificent!""
 court.7072.b:0 ""A travesty, I hate this!""
 court.7072.c:0 ""Acceptable, but will it be worth the expense?""
## Exotic Pet 
 court.7100.title:0 "Captured Beast"
 court.7100.desc:0 "All manner of strange occurrences have been known to happen in my court, but $master_of_hunt_court_position$ [huntmaster.GetFirstName] leading a #EMP [SCOPE.Custom('GetExoticPet')] #!into my throne room by a chain is not something I would have predicted, honestly.\n\n"My liege, I present to you this fine beast as a gift, a prize from my latest hunt! #EMP All #!rulers these days have exotic animals to grace their court and demonstrate their majesty!"\n\nIt is clear that [huntmaster.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] wants me to keep this thing!"

 court.7200.guitar.desc:0 "\n\nOf late, my $court_musician_court_position$ [loud_musician.GetFirstName] has obtained a new instrument, a citola I believe, and has taken to strumming on it loudly at all times during the day or night."

 court.7300.t:0 "Where's the Lamb Sauce?"
 court.7300.desc:1 "Attempts on my life are expected, and therefore the people I rely on for security must remain loyal and well-disposed towards me.

The food your court serves is utterly #EMP vile!#! I cannot believe you eat this gruel #EMP night after night after night..."#!\n\n"...This muck is hardly fit for a peasant's table!""
 court.7300.a:0 "#EMP Peasant's table? #!We must fix this at once!"

 court.7400.title:0 "Overstaying their Welcome?"
 court.7400.desc:1 "My court has become renowned for the luxurious level of hospitality on offer, and guests here often prove... useful.\n\nOn occasion however, we do get #EMP redundant #!guests at court, whose purpose is unclear and whose presence is an unnecessary drain on my treasury.\n\nOne such hanger-on is [guest.GetFirstName], who has been here for some time as a guest of [guest_liege.GetTitledFirstName] and seems to eat enough for twelve.\n\nThe [guest.GetWomanMan] is eating me out of house and home, and something #EMP must#! be done."

 court.7600.a:1 "These outings will be replaced by more proficuous studies."

Apparently, [child.GetSheHe] has decided that today is that day.\n\n "[ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather|U], can I have a destrier?"\n\n#EMP A warhorse?#! For a #EMP child?!#! As I ponder the request, I notice $master_of_horse_court_position$ [horsemaster.GetName] glancing at me from across the throne room.\n\nAt least I now know who my [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] has been talking to recently...."

My personal guard hesitantly move forward, unsure of whether to follow the commands of [huntmaster.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. I raise my hand to stop them, and ask [huntmaster.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] what gave [huntmaster.GetHerHim] reason to cause such a commotion.\n\n"My liege, this #EMP monster#! deliberately harmed [avian_abuser.GetHerHis] falcon during our last hunt!
