 funeral.1120.desc: "I and the other mourners take a reprieve from our grief to enjoy a great bounty of food. [other_mourner.GetName|U], usually the lifeblood of any feast, now sits across from me misty-eyed with an untouched goblet at [other_mourner.GetHerHis] side.\n\n"How can we make ourselves fat and merry in times like these? Are we to satisfy our hedonistic desires while [deceased.GetFirstName] has none? Join me! Empty your goblets in libation!"\n\nThe guests seem to agree, there is a wisdom in [other_mourner.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] oafish lamentation."

 funeral.1140.desc: "I take a reprieve from grieving amidst all the many souls come to offer their presence to [deceased.GetName]. Beyond the range of the doleful din, I hear some unearthly caterwauling echoing through the emptiness of the halls.\n\nAt its source, I find [soulmate.GetName] alone in a darkened room, [soulmate.GetHerHis] weeping quickly growing silent as [soulmate.GetSheHe] looks upon me with unfeeling eyes. In [soulmate.GetHerHis] hand is some dreadful unmarked bottle.\n\n"It shall not be long now until our wedding day.""
