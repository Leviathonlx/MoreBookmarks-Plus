 south_asia.0001.desc:0 "Crowds chant my name as I am purified in the waters of the heavenly springs. I rise as the Chakravarti, rightful and benevolent ruler of the entire world.\n\nMy [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural] tell me that it is time for the world to be guided by my light, but I do not need their assurances. As I gaze across the plains I can feel it in my soul."
 south_asia.0001.a:0 "The world speaks my name."

 south_asia.0002.t:0 "The Chakravarti"
 south_asia.0002.intro:0 "Crowds have been walking for days, or even weeks to attend the ceremony. [chakravarti.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] entire life has led to this one moment."
 south_asia.0002.text:0 "\n\nI watch in stunned silence as my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('chakravarti'))] emerges from the holy springs. [chakravarti.GetHerHis|U] [chakravarti.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural] announce [chakravarti.GetHerHim] as the Chakravarti, our benevolent [chakravarti.GetLadyLord].\n\nNone can now dispute that [chakravarti.GetSheHe] is the rightful ruler of the entire world."
 south_asia.0002.a:0 "I am honored to have witnessed this moment."
 south_asia.0002.b:0 "Let me cast myself at your feet in exultation!"

 south_asia.0003.text:0 "\n\nIt is only when my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('chakravarti'))] emerges from the holy springs that the full force of the moment strikes me. [chakravarti.GetHerHis|U] [chakravarti.GetFaith.AltPriestTermPlural] announce [chakravarti.GetHerHim] as the Chakravarti, the rightful ruler of all the world.\n\nAs [chakravarti.GetTitledFirstName] gazes over the plains below, I cannot help but feel that it is true."
 south_asia.0003.a:0 "Let me join you in your triumph, my liege!"
 south_asia.0003.b:0 "What is next for the ruler of the world?"

 south_asia.0004.relevant_religion:0 "Heralds have been arriving in droves to bring news from the Empire of India. For the first time in an age, a Chakravarti has risen."
 south_asia.0004.desc:0 "Heralds have arrived in great numbers from the land of India, announcing the rise of their "Chakravarti", enthusing about [chakravarti.GetHerHis] benevolence."
 south_asia.0004.text:0 "\n\nWith great rituals and hordes of believers at [chakravarti.GetHerHis] feet, [chakravarti.GetTitledFirstName] has adopted the mantle of the rightful ruler of the entire world."
 south_asia.0004.a:0 "Will [chakravarti.GetSheHe] be a new threat, or a great ally?"
 south_asia.0004.b:0 "The heathens can keep their ludicrous claims!"

 south_asia.0011.t:0 "The Sacred Waters"
 south_asia.0011.desc:0 "For an entire day, from sunrise to sundown, I stand waist-high in the flowing river. Cupping it in my hands, I raise the water towards the sky, before letting it fall. Over and over again.\n\nI am shaking by the time I return to dry land, where I am greeted by subordinate [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural]. I have sworn my protection to not only the water that has flowed through my hands today, but to the entire river, and through it, the eternity of existence."
 south_asia.0011.a:0 "None can doubt my dedication to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."

 south_asia.0012.desc:0 "With control over the entire course of the Ganges, [ruler_of_ganges.GetTitledFirstName] has claimed spiritual guardianship of its sacred waters. It is an unprecedented authority for someone to claim, but the [ruler_of_ganges.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural] have declared it true."
 south_asia.0012.a.like:0 "It seems eternity has a new protector."
 south_asia.0012.a.dislike:0 "As if anyone would respect an opportunist like [ruler_of_ganges.GetHerHim]!"

 south_asia.0013.t:0 "My Divine Purpose Usurped"
 south_asia.0013.desc:0 "With my loss of territory, my authority over the Ganges is no longer respected by the people and [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.PriestNeuterPlural] of my realm! Instead [ruler_of_ganges.GetTitledFirstName] has claimed the position I once commanded as the Steward of the Sacred River."
 south_asia.0013.a:0 "That upstart is nothing but a fraud!"

 south_asia.0021.t:0 "The [founder.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of $k_bene_israel$"
 south_asia.0021.desc:0 "Forced to live nomadic lives and living in small enclaves across the world, the Jewish people have lacked a home to call their own. The centuries of wandering, it seems, are at last at an end.\n\n[founder.GetNameNoTooltip] has been crowned [founder.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] of $k_bene_israel$. Though unlikely, it seems the Jewish people have found their home along the West coast of India, with the [founder.GetFaith.ReligiousHeadTitleName] restored and the declaration of a new Israel, [founder.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] believes [founder.GetHerselfHimself] to be ushering in a new golden age for followers of Judaism the world over."
 south_asia.0021.a:0 "A new home for us!"
 south_asia.0021.b:0 "There is only one Israel!"
 south_asia.0021.c:0 "What an unlikely coronation."
 
 
 south_asia.0030.t:0 "Spreading the Theravada Faith"
 south_asia.0030.desc:0 "Though we are one of the last bastions of Theravada teachings, our nobles continue to embrace the faith enthusiastically. The common folk, however, retain fierce pride in their traditional ways, and worship of their malevolent Nat deities remains widespread.\n\nA prudent ruler might find it wise to compromise when dealing with matters such as these, but perhaps a sterner approach is necessary..."
 south_asia.0030.a:0 "These simple-minded peasants need to be brought to heel!"
 south_asia.0030.b:0 "They are welcome to worship their old gods, within reason."

 south_asia.0031.t:0 "Religious Situation Escalates"
 south_asia.0031.desc:0 "It's one thing to be cultural interlopers; it's quite another to assert religious hegemony. The common folk are angry, and there's no shortage of derisive mutters at the mention of your name amongst the more traditional types at court, [ari_vassal.GetTitledFirstName] among them.\n\nMy hand could yet be open as a peacemaker, or curled as the fist of an unforgiving ruler. Or, further still, I could withdraw it entirely and let the flame burn itself out in time. I must choose wisely..."
 south_asia.0031.a:0 "Crush the rabble, and identify anyone who dares protect them."
 south_asia.0031.b:0 "We cannot afford destruction of the realm."
 south_asia.0031.c:0 "Send a message. Publicly execute the ringleaders."

 south_asia.0032.t:0 "Religious Tensions Ease"
 south_asia.0032.desc:0 "The traditional Burmese folk deities still remain entrenched, particularly in the rural areas. Removing the peoples' right to worship as they wish would do more harm than good, and so the introduction of a thirty-seventh deity — Thagyamin, the Buddhist protector God — into the pantheon as the first and foremost of them was received wholly amicably.\n\nA golden opportunity now stands before you. The traditional heartlands of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] Buddhism lie in Lanka, but it is constantly threatened by powers on the mainland. Alternatively, it could be time for us to decide the path of our newly-strengthened faith."
 south_asia.0032.a:0 "Invite religious refugees from Lanka to your court."

 south_asia.0033.desc:0 "The religious insurrectionists are gone. Those brave and foolish enough to resist were cut down, but the majority kept their mouths shut and heads down for fear of persecution. The [ari_vassal.GetFaith.GetAdjective] religious leaders fled to the countryside where they could continue to practice their animistic rituals. \n\nThe question now turns to those at court who were once so brazen with their support, and yet now find their tongues so very still."
 south_asia.0033.a:0 "All in my court must admit their adherence to the true faith!"
 south_asia.0033.b:0 "Enough blood has been shed; let them go."
 south_asia.0033.c:0 "You had your chance. GUARDS!"
 
 south_asia.0034.t:0 "Religious Conflict Averted"
 south_asia.0034.desc:0 "To push the country to the brink of civil war to defend the faith shows zeal, but knowing when to stay my hand displays compassion. The people continue to grumble, but so be it.\n\nThe religious divide in the Irrawaddy Valley remains, but at least my rulership over it remains intact, and the possibility of further conversion through conventional means remains possible."

 south_asia.0035.t:0 "Preserving Theravadan Homelands"
 south_asia.0035.desc:0 "Any true follower of the Buddha's notions can appreciate the sacred importance of preserving his words. The Pāli Canon, despite being written hundreds of years after Siddhārtha Gautama's death, represents the most accurate collection of the Buddha's words in the known world.\n\nWith the political machinations on the Indian mainland, there is a growing threat to the safety of such hallowed texts in the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] homelands on the peninsula of Lanka. I must act!"
 south_asia.0035.a:0 "We shall send faithful [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNameNoTooltip]s, to help preserve the faith."

 south_asia.0036.t:0 "Dealing with the Ari"
 south_asia.0036.desc:0 "With the faith's future outside of the Irrawaddy Valley now secure, the one remaining question is what to do with the remaining [ari_faith.GetName] monks who still wield so much power, yet flaunt their hedonism at every turn. Their influence could be undermined, yet cannot be underestimated.\n\nThese wine-drinking, animal sacrificing religious leaders must be dealt with, but dealt with delicately lest their persecution is seen as a threat to the still-vulnerable peace in the region."
 south_asia.0036.a:0 "The people need to know of their sins. Divide and conquer."
 south_asia.0036.b:0 "They can convert, or they can flee to the forests and mountains."
 south_asia.0036.b.tt:0 "All other counties in Burma"
 
 south_asia.0037.t:0 "The Faith Secured"
 south_asia.0037.desc:0 "As the last vestiges of the monks' power melts away, it is as though a millstone has been lifted off my shoulders. The religious relations in the kingdom are harmonious, the faith is thriving, and the people rightly look to me as their leader both politically and spiritually.\n\nMy great journey is at an end, and my realm can rightly call itself a true bastion of a strong and healthy [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName] faith."

 south_asia.0038.t:0 "The Great Divide"
 south_asia.0038.desc:0 "For many years now, the faithful across the Irrawaddy Valley have been struggling with a true religious divide. The city-dwelling nobles and their ilk are adherents of [proselytiser.GetFaith.GetName], whereas the common folk and those who live in the sprawling forests of the valley continue to worship the varied deities and spirits of the Ari faith.\n\nMe liege [proselytiser.GetFullName] has taken it upon [proselytiser.GetHerHim]self to heal this divide and establish the Theravada faith as the dominant one in [proselytiser.GetHerHis] lands and, by extension, mine too. Even now, [proselytiser.GetHerHis] monks sweep across my lands, refashioning the religious landscape in their preferred image."
 south_asia.0038.a:0 "The Theravada faith shall thrive!"
 south_asia.0038.b:0 "This is an outrage!"
 south_asia.0038.c:0 "This is no more than the usual nonsense."
 south_asia.0038.tt:0 "Several of your [counties|E] may flip to the Theravada faith."

 south_asia.0039.t:0 "A Brutal Zealot"
 south_asia.0039.desc:0 "The evangelizing work of [proselytiser.GetFullName] appears to have gone poorly. [proselytiser.GetHerHis|U] heavy-handed approach to spreading the Theravada faith has resulted in uproar and protests, which have subsequently been brutally crushed.\n\nAny lord or lady who dared protect an adherent of the embattled Ari faith has either vanished or now insists that they were misquoted, and none dare challenge the patience of their zealous liege.\n\nWhether there are further ramifications for those who were known to be on the side of the oppressed remains to be seen..."
 south_asia.0039.a:0 "It is no more than they deserve."
 south_asia.0039.b:0 "One day, the fallen faithful will be avenged."
 south_asia.0039.c:0 "Just more petty squabbling between heathens."

 south_asia.0040.t:0 "A Faith Secured?"
 south_asia.0040.desc:1 "[proselytiser.GetFullName], my liege and the ruler of these lands, has been hard at work converting the populace to [proselytiser.GetHerHis] faith, [proselytiser.GetFaith.GetName]. As [proselytiser.GetHerHis] machinations progress, it has been impossible to stop the flood of preachers and Bhāṇakas venturing through my lands to spread their faith, and that of their [proselytiser.GetLadyLord]'s.\n\nEven as Theravada takes hold, the traditional Ari adherents melt away into forest strongholds around the Arakan mountains, dwindling in numbers and shying away from open worship."
 south_asia.0040.a:0 "Wonderful! The true faith shall flourish!"
 south_asia.0040.b:0 "These actions will not go unremembered."
 south_asia.0040.c:0 "This really is no concern of mine."

 south_asia.0041.t:0 "A Gift From Abroad"
 south_asia.0041.desc:0 "It is the fifth monk of the day passing through my court that arouses my interest; it's rare for members of the faith to be so common out in the open. A quick questioning reveals the reason for this new deluge of the faithful across my lands.\n\n[proselytiser.GetFullName], a foreign [proselytiser.GetLadyLord], has been establishing the [proselytiser.GetFaith.GetName] faith across [proselytiser.GetHerHis] realm, and word has reached them about the trials and tribulations our shared faith has undergone in my realm over past generations as well.\n\nIn response, [proselytiser.GerSheHe] has sent many bhikku to help spread and support the faith in its ancestral homelands."
 south_asia.0041.a:0 "I will not forget this gesture."
