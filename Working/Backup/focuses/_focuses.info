Note: obviously very incomplete...

my_focus = {
	is_valid_showing_failures_only = { ... }	# can choose focus; these will be shown only if they fail; scope: character; default: { always = yes }
	
	is_valid = { ... }				# can choose focus; scope: character; default: { always = yes }
	
	lifestyle = some key			# What lifestyle the focus belongs to. Adding this will make it a lifestyle focus
	
	icon = some_key					# What key to use for the icon; if not defined, will use the key of the focus
	
	auto_selection_weight = {}		# Script value for selection weight. Scope is the character. If omitted, default weight is 1000
