This folder ties names from different cultures to one another.
When changing culture, if the character's current name is equivalent to a name in the resulting culture, the character will change name.

== Format ==
For men, the names "Henrik", "Heinrich", and "Henrich" will be considered the same for naming purposes.
henrik_male = { "Henrik" "Heinrich" "Henrich" }
Lack of a postfix will also be interpreted as male.

For women, the names "Matilda" and "Mathilda" will be considered the same for naming purposes.
matilda_female = { "Matilda" "Mathilda" }

The keys are arbitrary except "_male" or "_female" at the end.
