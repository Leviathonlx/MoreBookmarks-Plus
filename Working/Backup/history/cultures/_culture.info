Name of the file is the culture key that should get the history.
Culture groups can be used too; if a file exists for an individual culture that'll be used rather than the group. E.G., if "north_germanic_group.txt" and "norwegian.txt" both exist, Norwegian culture will use "norwegian.txt" while Swedish culture will use "north_germanic_group.txt".

date = {									# When is executed
	discover_innovation = innovation_key	# Discovers this innovations. There can be multiple per date.
	add_innovation_progress = {				# Advances a % defined on the defined innovation. There can be multiple per date.
		culture_innovation = innovation_key # Innovation
		progress = 50						# How much progress dos it gains
	}
	join_era = culture_era_key				# Joins the defined era. Only one per date.
	progress_era = 50						# Progress inthe current era. Only one per date.
