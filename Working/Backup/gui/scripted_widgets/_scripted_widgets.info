Files here can contain pairs of file path and widget names to automatically create widgets on startup that are not formally referenced by the code.

eg:
gui/test_custom_widget.gui = my_first_cool_test_widget
gui/test_custom_widget.gui = my_second_cool_test_widget

Each entry will create one of that new widget, so making the same widget twice is supported though they will initially appear in the same location since the widget has the same ones scripted each time.

All files will be loaded so multipe mods can load their own widgets as long as they don't mess with each other's pathing which would be rude if they did.
