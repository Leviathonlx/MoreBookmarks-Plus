# Name must match a landed title definition
title_name = {
	item = { # One or more items
		trigger = { # Trigger for when this item should be picked, first valid item is picked, root = the title
			<trigger>
		}
		coat_of_arms = name # Name of coat of arms to use
	}
}

If no item is matched then falls back to the default coat of arms for that title

# Effect
# Use in a title, will update their coat of arms
update_dynamic_coa = yes

It is on the scripter to use this effect in an on action related to some trigger you are checking, so if you use faith as a trigger then you should use that as a hook in to update all of a character's titles.
So try to keep the types of triggers you use fairly consistent so we only need to do this update in a few palces
