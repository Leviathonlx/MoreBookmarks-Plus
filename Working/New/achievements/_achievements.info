Achievements Flags
==================

When we add flags etc for achievements, we need to do it in a certain roundabout way, or else it'll trigger errors when running some of our automated tests. For context, these tests run the game without graphics, which for one reason or another, don't read achievements.
Thus if the only place an achievement flag/variable is read is inside the achievement script, we end up with errors like these during the test:

[15:36:43][jomini_effect.cpp:324]: Character flag 'rd_character_blocked_far_from_home_achievement' is set but is never used
[15:36:43][jomini_effect.cpp:324]: Variable 'first_of_the_crusader_kings_achievement_flag' is set but is never used

Instead use the scripted achievement effects such as add_achievement_flag_effect.
They will suppress the above errors by adding dummy usages as well.

Look for all effects in achievement_effects.txt, the different effects are used for different kinds of achievement checks.
