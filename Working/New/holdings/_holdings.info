== Structure ==

name_of_the_holding = {
	# optional flags assigned to the holding type
	flag = castle
	flag = city

	# the primary building for this holding (will be built when creating a holding of this type)
	primary_building = city_01
	
	# first levels of all buildings buildable in the holding, doesn't include the primary building
	buildings = {
		city_market_01
		common_shipyard_01
		...
	}
	
	# Can a barony with this holding be inherited? (yes by default)
	can_be_inherited = yes/no
}

== Modifiers ==
The following modifiers are automatically generated for all holding types:

* <holding_type>_build_speed (example: church_holding_build_speed)
* <holding_type>_build_gold_cost
* <holding_type>_build_piety_cost
* <holding_type>_build_prestige_cost
* <holding_type>_holding_build_speed
* <holding_type>_holding_build_gold_cost
* <holding_type>_holding_build_piety_cost
* <holding_type>_holding_build_prestige_cost
These affect building buildings within such a holding or the holdings themselves.

These work everywhere the more generic version works. E.G., church_holding_build_speed will work everywhere build_speed does.
