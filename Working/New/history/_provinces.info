# Set which holding type to use in the province. Default = auto.
# <holding_type> can be any holding type in common/holdings.
# none will not auto-generate any holding in that province
# auto will select a holding for the province automatically to fill the county with different holdings. See required_county_holdings in common/governments.
holding = <holding type> / none / auto

# To script Special Buildings, use 'special_building_slot = building_type' for just the slot, and 'special_building = building_type' for actually building the building.

# Set buildings in the holding (requires an explicit holding to be present - auto doesn't work).
# In a later history entry, this overrides all previous buildings.

special_building_slot = X		# Enables and sets the special building slot for building X
special_building = X			# Same as special_building_slot, but also builds the actual building in the slot
duchy_capital_building = X		# Builds the capital duchy building X (only for duchy capitals)
