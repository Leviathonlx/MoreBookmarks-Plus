 game_concept_T4N_tributary: "Tributary"  
 game_concept_T4N_tributary_desc: "A tributary state is a term for a pre-modern state in a particular type of subordinate relationship to a more powerful state which involved the sending of a regular token of submission, or tribute , to the superior power [T4N_suzerain|E]. This token often took the form of a substantial transfer of wealth, such as the delivery of gold, produce, or slaves, so that tribute might best be seen as the payment of protection money . "

 game_concept_T4N_suzerain: "Suzerain"
 game_concept_T4N_suzerain_desc: "Suzerainty is a relationship in which one state or other polity controls the foreign policy and relations of a tributary state, while allowing the tributary state to have internal autonomy. The dominant state is called the "suzerain". Suzerainty differs from sovereignty in that the tributary state is technically independent, but enjoys only limited self-rule."
