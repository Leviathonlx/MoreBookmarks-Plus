The tradition is now extinct, but lives on in the significant influence it has on the modern Hadiya, regardless of religious affiliation."

 south_ethiopia.0096.desc:0 "Recently, some of my servants have proposed to me that we plant some more enset trees around my residence. Besides being a good food source, their survivability and resistance to drought means that they make for reliable shade, emergency food, and an extra small level of security to deter any would-be intruders."
 south_ethiopia.0096.a:0 "Good idea! Go plant some enset trees."
 south_ethiopia.0096.b:0 "No, we don’t need to do this right now."
