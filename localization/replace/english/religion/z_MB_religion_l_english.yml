 arianism_desc: "Arianism is a Christological doctrine first attributed to Arius (c. AD 256–336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt. Arian theology holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who was begotten by God the Father, and is distinct from the Father (therefore subordinate to him). However, in contrast with traditional Trinitarianism, Arianism holds that the Son is also the Son of God, but not co-eternal with God the Father in contrast. Much of south-eastern Europe and central Europe, including many of the Goths and Vandals respectively, had embraced Arianism (the Visigoths converted to Arian Christianity in 376 through their bishop Wulfila), which led to Arianism being a religious factor in various wars in the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the west, organized Arianism survived in North Africa, in Hispania, and parts of Italy until it was finally suppressed in the 6th and 7th centuries. Visigothic Spain converted to Nicene Christianity through their king Reccared I at the Third Council of Toledo in 589. Grimoald, King of the Lombards (662–671), and his young son and successor Garibald (671), were the last Arian kings in Europe."

His later deposition was not recognized by the Miaphisite party, and thus a distinctive (autocephalous) miaphysite patriarchate was established, headed by Severus and his successors.

 orthodox: "Greek Orthodoxy" #Don't want the anachronistic 'Byzantine'. Even Eastern Orthodox wasn't used till more recently. Going with what it actually was called in this timeframe also keeps it consistent with other Orthodox churches such as the Bulgarian and Georgian churches. I'm sure I'll get some complaints still.
 orthodox_adj: "Greek Orthodox"
 orthodox_desc: "The Orthodox Church is the other main branch of Chalcedonian Christianity that up until 1054 was formally united with the Catholic Church, although the political division can be traced back to the crowning of Charlemagne as Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in 800, which did not sit well with the Emperor in Constantinople.

 mozarabic_church: "Mozarabic Rite" #Mainly to keep it consistent with similar things like the Aquilean Rite
 mozarabic_church_adj: "Mozarabic"
 mozarabic_church_desc: "The Mozarabic Rite, in the past also called the Visigothic Rite, is a liturgical rite of the Latin Church once used generally in the Iberian Peninsula. A descendant of the early Iberian rites, Mozarabic Christianity has maintained a level of independence from Rome due to centuries under Islamic rule. Their long cohabitation with other faiths has made them more accepting of differences than more fundamentalist sects. The Kingdoms to the north began to follow Roman liturgy. One factor for the spread of the Roman liturgy into Iberia was the alliances the Christian kings made with Frankish rulers and monks. Another factor was the suspicion that the Hispanic liturgy might be unorthodox or heretical.\n\nWhile the liturgy is often called 'Mozarabic' after the Christian communities that lived under Muslim rulers in Al-Andalus that preserved its use, the rite itself developed before and during the Visigothic period. After experiencing a period of decline during the Reconquista, when it was superseded by the Roman Rite in the Christian states of Iberia as part of a wider programme of liturgical standardization within the Catholic Church, efforts were taken in the 16th century to revive the rite and ensure its continued presence in the city of Toledo, where it is still celebrated today."

 insular_celtic_adj: "Celtic Catholic"
 insular_celtic_adherent: "Celticist"
 insular_celtic_adherent_plural: "Celticists"
 insular_celtic_desc:1 "A rural church that drifted away from Roman Catholic orthodoxy some centuries ago, Celtic Catholicism has lost many of its once-distinctive features at the insistence of its mother-church. It yet retains a greater emphasis on penance and monasticism, and incorporates many traditional Celtic marriage customs foreign to wider Christendom.\n\nThe term Celtic Church is deprecated by many historians as it implies a unified and identifiable entity entirely separate from that of mainstream Western Christendom. For this reason, many prefer the term Insular Christianity due to misconceptions that the Roman and Celtic Church were opposed to each other. However, many modern scholars outright reject the existence of the Church regardless of its name due to the lack of substantiating evidence."
 
 coptic_desc: "Coptic Christianity, also known as the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, finds its roots in the apostolic teachings of Saint Mark during the 1st century. Serving as the predominant Christian denomination in medieval Egypt, the Coptic Orthodox Church upholds a unique liturgical tradition, employing the ancient Coptic language in its worship practices. Adherents uphold the Nicene Creed and honor the Councils of Nicaea and Ephesus. The Coptic Church is famous for both being the birthplace of Christian monasticism as well as maintaining a long tradition of the promotion of education and philosophy."
 
 armenian_apostolic_desc: "Armenian Apostolic Christianity, one of the world's oldest Christian traditions, traces its origins to the Apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew in the early 1st century. Firmly rooted in Armenia's history, this ancient faith, officially known as the Armenian Apostolic Church, boasts a distinctive liturgical heritage and language, with liturgy conducted in Classical Armenian. The Armenian Apostolic Church rapidly gained followers in the region and shepherded the Kingdom of Armenia into becoming the first state ever to adopt Christianity as its official religion."
 
 paulician_desc: "Paulicianism is Christian Gnostic heresy influenced by Manichaeism, originating in Armenia, and known for its militarist attitude and emphasis on only accepting the New Testament as legitimate. Rejecting the divinity of Christ and viewing the veneration of the cross as heathenish, Paulicians aim to restore what they believe to be the true form of Christianity as laid out by Paul of Tarsus."
 
 #TENETS

 tenet_junior_patriarchate_name: "Junior Patriarchate"
 tenet_junior_patriarchate_desc: "While a place of prestige will always be set aside for the Pentarchy, there exists a need for new patriarchates to aid in the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church."
 tenet_mission_territory_name: "Mission Territory"
 tenet_mission_territory_desc: "This faith can hardly be considered one faith, on account of it being spread over such a vast area with such little unity. It can not rightly be considered a distinct form of Christianity, but rather exists to open the floodgates to a variety of new Christian sects among a previously pagan population."

 FAITH_DOCTRINES_CHURCH: "[theologies|E] and [syncretism|E]"
 game_concept_theology_desc: "Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine, or more broadly of religious belief. The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world."
 game_concept_syncretic_desc: "Syncretism is the practice of combining different beliefs and various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths."

Erzya traditional spirituality, deeply rooted in the cultural and natural landscape of the Erzya people, reflects a rich tapestry of animistic and shamanic traditions. At the core of Erzya paganism is a reverence for the forces of nature, spirits, and deities that inhabit the world around them. Shamans, known as "šoš," play a central role in Erzya pagan practices. These spiritual intermediaries engage in rituals, trance-like states, and communing with the spirit world to seek guidance, healing, and to maintain harmony within the community. Through drumming, chanting, and other ceremonial practices, the šoš navigate the realms of the divine and act as mediators between the human and spiritual dimensions."

Through rituals, ecstatic experiences, and communication with the divine, murtads seek to maintain balance, offer guidance, and facilitate healing within the community. Ceremonial practices, including drumming, chanting, and symbolic gestures, play a crucial role in these spiritual endeavors."

 mari_pagan_desc: "Mari traditional spirituality, rooted in the ancient beliefs of the Mari people, reflects a profound connection to the natural world and a spiritual landscape populated by various deities and spirits. Animism and shamanic practices have played significant roles in Mari traditional religion. Central to Mari paganism is the reverence for nature, with spirits inhabiting forests, rivers, mountains, and other natural features. The shaman, known as "kugu," held a vital position as an intermediary between the human community and the spirit world. Through rituals, drumming, and trance-like states, the kugu sought guidance, healing, and maintained harmony within the community."
