His followers, known as Aerians, fasted on Sundays and would not do so on the appointed fast-days, even during Holy Week.\n\nFor a time, he had many followers in Sebaste, but he could not make his teachings widely popular."

Central to their beliefs was the idea of a divine spark within each individual, fostering a direct and unmediated connection between the human soul and God. This pantheistic philosophy, emphasizing a profound spiritual union, brought them into conflict with the established Church. Amalric of Bena was posthumously declared a heretic, and although the movement declined, its ideas are believed to have influenced later mystical movements, including the Brethren of the Free Spirit in the later Middle Ages. The Amalricians played a role in shaping medieval discussions on the relationship between humanity and the divine."
