 game_concept_briton: "Briton"
 game_concept_romano_briton_desc: "The Romano-Britons, or simply Britons, were the varyingly Romanized [oldbrit|E] who inhabited Britannia until the 5th century AD when the province gradually fell into a military anarchy due to Pictish, Irish and Saxon [raids|E].\n\nWhen Rome finally gave up Britain around the year 440 AD, opportunistic British warlords established their own [kingdoms|E] utilizing Germanic [mercenaries|E] who often tended to usurp leadership for themselves. \nIn some cases however, the ruling elite seems to have maintained itself and simply got assimilated by their retinues over the centuries.\n\nBy the 7th century, the Britons have either been culturally assimilated into new [anglosaxon|E] groups, or have gradually evolved into the various Brythonic peoples."

 game_concept_old_briton_desc: "The Pritanīans were the original inhabitants of the island of Britain prior to the Roman conquest. \n\nAfter Claudius’ Invasion, the island was gradually integrated into the wider Roman world, leading to the steady Romanization of the Pritanīans within the province while those beyond the walls to the north would eventually evolve into the ancestors of the Picts. \n\nWhile the original Pritanīans are long gone, their language, as well as aspects of their culture, survive in the later [romanobrit|E] and Pictish traditions."

 game_concept_anglo_saxon: "Anglo-Saxons"
 game_concept_anglo_saxon_desc: "The Anglo-Saxons were a collection of Ænglisċ speaking peoples that inhabited Britain since the Sub-Roman Period from 5th century onward. \n\nDescending from the assimilated [romano_briton|E] and various Germanic [mercenaries|E] groups, they were never a truly unified force. However, due to the efforts of writers like Bede, the ænglisc speaking inhabitants of the many Germanic [kingdoms|E] would gradually develop a common Angelcynn identity that distinguished itself from the Franks on the mainland and Brittonic speaking [romano_briton|E] of Wales and Cornwall."

 game_concept_east_slavs: "East Slavs"
 game_concept_east_slavs_desc: "The East Slavs, also known as the Rus or Ruthenians, are the descendants of the [old_slavs|E] who migrated east from their ancestral homeland of Podlasia.\n\nSettling in the Pontic Steppe and the formerly Baltic and Finno-Ugric lands to the north, these East Slavs would gradually fall under the influence of North Germanic, Varangian raiders, as well as under Byzantine influence that gradually spread northwards from the Black Sea. By the 9th century, the Eastern Slavs were divided into various tribes who were varyingly influenced by their many neighbors before the eventual rise of the Kievan Rus.\n\nCharacterized by Byzantine and North Germanic influenced [culture|E] and their East Slavic [heritage|E], the East Slavs form the link between the [west_slavs|E] and [south_slavs|E]."

 game_concept_west_slavs_desc: "The West Slavs, colloquially also known as the Wends or Lechites, are the descendants of the [old_slavs|E] who migrated west into the formerly Germanic lands of the Lugians, Gothones and Warini.\n\nSettling along the Vistula, Oder and Elbe rivers, the various West Slavic tribes would gradually repopulate these lands after the departure of its previous inhabitants while simultaneously assimilating the few groups who stayed behind. By the 9th century, most of these Lechitic tribes have established themselves in the western section of the Northern European Plain and became ever more entangled with the Frankish and Bulgarian states that surrounded them which contributed to the rise of native principalities such as Moravia or Poland.\n\nCharacterized by their Frankish influenced [culture|E] and their West Slavic [heritage|E], the West Slavs form the northern link between the [east_slavs|E] and [pannonian_slavs|E]."

 game_concept_south_slavs_desc: "The South Slavs, colloquially also known as the Sclavenians or Illyrians, are the descendants of the [old_slavs|E] who fled the advance of the Avars by crossing into Byzantine territory over the course of the 6th and 7th centuries.\n\nRapidly settling the territories stretching from the Black Sea to the Dinaric Alps, the South Slavs became the dominant ethno-linguistic group in the Balkans by the 9th century, having assimilated most of the local Greek, Romance and old Illyrian peoples who resided there.\n\nCharacterized by their Byzantine and Frankish influenced [culture|E] and their South Slavic [heritage|E], the South Slavs form the southern link between the [east_slavs|E] and [pannonian_slavs|E]."

 game_concept_pannonian_slavs_desc: "The Pannonian Slavs are the descendants of the [old_slavs|E] who lived under Avar rule from the 6th to 9th centuries.\n\nFollowing the disintegration of the Avar Khaganate in the late 8th century, the Pannonian Slavs utilized the power-vacuum left behind to establish a series of their own principalities such as Savia, Balaton and Carantania, all of which would all gradually fall into the Frankish orbit during the 9th century to varying degrees.\n\nCharacterized by their Frankish influenced [culture|E] and mixed South- and West Slavic [heritage|E], the Pannonian Slavs form the link between the [south_slavs|E] and [west_slavs|E]."
 
 game_concept_oldslavic: "Slavic"
 game_concept_old_slavs: "Slavs"
 game_concept_old_slavs_desc: "The Slavs are the ancestors of the many Slavic peoples that came to inhabit much of Eastern Europe starting in the 6th century AD.\n\nWhile the exact origin and ethnogenesis of the Slavs remains a mystery even to the present day, a likely homeland for these Old Slavs rests within the Podlasia region between Ukraine and Belarus from where these Slavs would start to migrate East, South and West into Ruthenia, Poland, Eastern Germany, Pannonia and the Balkans. While it is most likely that many Slavic peoples can trace their origin to pre-existing peoples that would come to be assimilated because of these Slavic migrations, they nevertheless considered themselves, and were considered by their neighbors, to, more or less, constitute a single people even up until the early modern period.\n\nIn the game, the Slavs are the ancestral culture of the various East, West and South and Pannonian Slavic peoples."

 game_concept_iranians_desc: "The Ērānians, colloquially also known as the Sasanians, or sometimes simply and mistakenly known as 'Persians', were the inhabitants of the Sassanid Empire that dominated Iran from the 3rd century until the 7th century.\n\nThe House of Sasan arose from the historical province of Pars and would, in the 3rd century AD, overthrow the Arsacid Parthians that had ruled Iran up until that point, thus giving rise to the Sasanian Empire that would come to dominate the plateau for the next four centuries. Styling itself as a restored Achaemenid Empire, even coming close to re-establishing the historical boundaries during final the Sassanid-Byzantine war, the Sassanid Empire was eventually left weakened after decades of war and thus became an easy target for the early Islamic Caliphate.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Islamic Conquest of Iran, the many peoples of the former empire began to slowly convert to the new religion, giving rise to new native Iranian dynasties such as the Saffarids or Samanids during the Iranian Intermezzo. Apart from being the main force behind the integration of Khwarazm and Sogdiana into the Ērānian sphere, these dynasties were also patrons of the culture and arts that gave rise to the Islamic-Persian cultural fusion.\n\nCharacterized by their Iranian [heritage|E] and various Iranian [languages|E] such as Persian, Khwarazmian or Caspian, the many descendants of the Ērānians still form the dominant group on the Iranian plateau and in Central Asia."

During the migration age, many tribes such as the Taifals or Alans moved into the Roman Empire, setting up their own kingdoms along with Germanic groups such as the Vandals in North Africa.\n\nIn the aftermath of these migrations, those Eastern Iranians who were left behind gradually assimilated into new emergent groups such as the various Turkic or [oldslavic|E] peoples, though some remain such as the Alans of the Caucasus or the Saka of the Tarim Basin.\n\nCharacterized by their Serindian and Sarmatian [heritage|E], as well as their various Iranian [languages|E] such as Alanian, Sogdian or Saka, the Eastern Iranians are primarily found in Alania, Kashgar, Khotan, as well as in various pockets throughout India."
