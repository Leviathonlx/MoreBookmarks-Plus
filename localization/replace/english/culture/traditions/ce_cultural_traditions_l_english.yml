 tradition_roman_pride_name: "Roman Pride"
 tradition_roman_pride_desc: "The exclusiveness and the pride of the Byzantines were reflected in the word that they used to describe themselves. They and they alone were the Rhōmaîoi, the true Romans; and every citizen of whatever race - Greek, Armenian, or Slav, was aware of his right to call himself a 'Rhomaios'.\n\nTo be a Romaios was not to belong to any one nation. It was rather to belong to the world - made up of one Empire and one Church, governed by one Emperor who survived the storms of the barbarian invasions and the collapse of the western provinces, and that to live outside it was a great misfortune which Providence would one day rectify.\n\nTo them, their Emperor was the elect of God, crowned and guarded by the Heavenly Father. His person was sacred and he ruled from the Sacred Palace in the Queen of Cities as God's regent on earth - he was the terrestrial image of the Logos of God reigning over the earthly reflexion of the Kingdom of Heaven. The Empire was not, like the kingdoms or principalities of antiquity, a temporary phenomenon which would one day come to an end. It was a realm foreseen in the plan of the Creator, anchored in Christian eschatology, organically involved in the age-old history of mankind and destined to endure until the Second Coming. Those who affected to challenge or ignore this divinely ordained scheme of things were guilty of a form of heresy."
 
 tradition_karabisianoi_name: "Karabisianoi"
 tradition_karabisianoi_desc: "The Byzantine navy was a unique and essential component of the Eastern Roman Empire. Like the empire it served, it was a direct continuation from its Imperial Roman predecessor, but played a far greater role in the defence and survival of the state than its earlier iteration. While the fleets of the unified Roman Empire faced few great naval threats, operating as a policing force vastly inferior in power and prestige to the legions, the sea became vital to the very existence of the Byzantine state, which several historians have called a "maritime empire"."
 
 tradition_justinian_code_name: "Corpus Juris Civilis"
 tradition_justinian_code_desc: "The Justinian Code or Corpus Juris Civilis (Corpus of Civil Law) was a major reform of Byzantine law created by Emperor Justinian I (r. 527-565 CE) in 528-9 CE. Aiming to clarify and update the old Roman laws, eradicate inconsistencies, and speed up legal processes, the collection of imperial edicts and expert opinions covered all manner of topics from punishments for specific crimes to marriage and the inheritance of property. It was a truly Herculean task which involved studying hundreds of documents and Latin Roman laws dating back to the early Roman Republic of the West. The Corpus Juris Civilis was eventually made up of four main parts: Codex Justinianus (Justinian's Code - a collection of 12 books containing 4,562 imperial edicts from the time of Hadrian to Justinian I himself, organised by theme and all correctly attributed to the emperor who had made them and with a date), Digestum (or Pandectae) ("the Digest" (or "Pandects") - a compendium of legal opinions by celebrated Roman jurists of the past, which could be cited by claimants and defenders in court), Institutiones ("the Institutes" - a sort of handbook of the Codex and Digestum for law students to better understand and apply them), and Novellae Constitutiones ("the Novels" or "New Laws" - a collection of the imperial edicts made by Justinian between 534 and 565 CE, the final year of his reign). Not only used as a basis for Byzantine law for over 900 years, the laws therein continue to influence many western legal systems to this day."
 
 tradition_veche_name: "Veche"
 tradition_veche_desc: "Veche was a popular assembly in medieval Slavic countries. In Novgorod and in Pskov, where the veche acquired great prominence, the veche was broadly similar to the Norse thing or the Swiss Landsgemeinde. The East Slavic veche is thought to have originated in tribal assemblies of Eastern Europe, thus predating the Rus' state. The earliest mentions of veche in East European chronicles refer to examples in Belgorod Kievsky in 997, Novgorod in 1016, Kiev in 1068, and in Pskov in 1123. The assemblies consisted of all the adult males in the population and discussed matters of war and peace, adopted laws, and made agreements with their rulers or expelled them and invited others to take their place. In Kiev, the veche was summoned in front of the Cathedral of St Sophia."
 
 tradition_rashidun_army_name: "Legacy of the Rashidun"
 tradition_rashidun_army_desc: "The Rashidun army was the core of the Rashidun Caliphate's armed forces during the early Muslim conquests in the 7th century. The army is reported to have maintained a high level of discipline, strategic prowess, and organization, which granted them successive victories in their various campaigns. In its time, the Rashidun army was a very powerful and effective force, serving as a key component in the Rashidun Caliphate's territorial expansion and served as a medium for the early spread of Islam into the territories it conquered. Though much has changed since the early Muslim conquests, the legacy of this mighty force remains with us to this day."
 
 tradition_pagan_protectors_name: "Guardians of the Faith"
 tradition_pagan_protectors_desc: "Sworn to defending the earthly sanctums of our Pagan gods, these warriors show no mercy to those who seek to defile our temples or sanctuaries. Riding high on powerful steeds, any foe who ventures within the reach of the Dievas' Guard is sure to have chunks of flesh torn from his body by their brutal war forks while Giltine's Chosen serve as well-equipped solid infantry as their polearms make them effective against both foot and mounted foes."
 
 tradition_sasanian_army_name: "Legacy of the Sasanian Empire"
 tradition_sasanian_army_desc: "The Sasanian army was the primary military body of the Sassanid Empire that dates back to the rise of Ardashir I (r. 224–241), the founder of the Sasanian Empire, to the throne. Ardashir aimed at the revival of the Persian Empire, and to further this aim, he reformed the military by forming a standing army which was under his personal command. He restored the Achaemenid military organizations, retained the Parthian cavalry model, and employed new types of armour and siege warfare techniques. This was the beginning for a military system which served him and his successors for over 400 years, during which the Sasanian Empire was, along with the Roman Empire and later the East Roman Empire, one of the two superpowers of Late Antiquity in Western Eurasia. Though the Sassanid Empire has fallen, its memory remains with us and serves as a model for our forces to this day."
 
 tradition_teulu_name: "Teulu"
 tradition_teulu_desc: "The 'teulu' were the personal bodyguard of the Welsh chieftains. They followed a tradition common in other Anglo-Saxon and Germanic societies of the time, whereby close companions and retainers to the lord or king fought alongside him in battle with unwavering loyalty and skill. In this way they are analogous to the hearth companions of the Saxons and the housecarls of the Danes and Anglo-Saxons. Teulu literally means 'family', which implies the close bond they shared with their lord. Riding into battle carrying spears and shields, clad in mail, they were in many ways much like early knights. On the battlefield they were visibly-similar, charging down their enemies with spear or lance in their lord's name."
 
 tradition_barbary_corsairs_name: "Barbary Corsairs"
 tradition_barbary_corsairs_desc: "Though the practice of piracy and raiding had always plagued the Mediterranean, the coastal Berber states were able to vastly enrich themselves at the expense of their European neighbors. Such raids were such a thorn in the side of Italian, French, and Iberian rulers that the Sicilian Normans invaded North Africa in 1135, and in 1390, a French-Genoese joint military expedition embarked on the short-lived Barbary Crusade."

 tradition_almogavars_name: "Almogávares"
 tradition_almogavars_desc: "Almogávares, while first used to identify small armed groups of Saracens that engaged in looting and surprise attacks, came to refer to a class of light infantry soldier from the Crown of Aragon used in the later phases of the Reconquista, during the 13th and 14th centuries. Almogávares were lightly clad, quick-moving frontiersmen and foot-soldiers. They hailed from the Kingdom of Aragon, the Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Valencia, the Crown of Castile, and the Kingdom of Portugal. At first these troops were formed by farmers and shepherds originating from the countryside, woods, and frontier mountain areas that were left unable to use their valleys in winter because they had been occupied. In order to continue to survive, these shepherds had to organize themselves into bands of outlaws and penetrate the enemy domain in search of what their people needed to survive. After many generations of leading this new kind of life that they had been pushed into by the invaders, it seems clear that a genuine warrior spirit formed in these shepherd communities that was utilized by the Christian Iberian kingdoms. Over the following centuries, the Almogávares would grow to considered one of the best infantries of their era."

 tradition_mamluk_military_name: "Mamluk Military"
 tradition_mamluk_military_desc: "Mamluks were military slave soldiers, purchased, trained and equipped to fight on the behalf of the ruler as well as perform administrative duties. Since the rule of the Tulunids, they were also employed alongside infantry slave soldiers from Sudan who have a long history of serving the ruling Arab dynasties in the Muslim world."

 tradition_irish_cliathairi_name: "Cliathairi"
 tradition_irish_cliathairi_desc: "Cliathairi were the professional "guards" around a king, who formed the backbone of an army in the Gaelic warfare of Medieval Ireland, having chosen military service as a career. These professional soldiers were often employed by landholders as an affordable defense against brigands. When called upon by chieftans or kings during times of war, these soldiers are one of the few units in the Irish army trained in the effective use of the long spear. In battle, they would be accompanied by Ridire - knights of noble Gaelic heritage who were afforded great respect in Irish society. Favouring a light lance and mace, they would fill the niche between light and heavy cavalry."

 tradition_damascus_steel_name: "Damascus Steel"
 tradition_damascus_steel_desc: "Damascus steel was the forged steel of the blades of swords smithed in the Near East from ingots of Wootz steel. These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water, sometimes in a "ladder" or "rose" pattern. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering, and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge." 

 tradition_toledo_steel_name: "Toledo Steel"
 tradition_toledo_steel_desc: "Toledo steel, historically known for its high quality alloy and unusually high durability, is from Toledo, Spain, which has been a traditional sword-making, metal-working center since about the Roman period. Toledo steel forging techniques were developed from ancient Spanish customs and used to forge many different types of weapons over the course of many centuries. In simple terms, the Toledo steel technique consisted of a steel blade that enveloped a wrought iron strip, thus preventing the steel from bending or cracking. As such, the strong and durable Toledo steel weapons were said to have had a 'soul of iron'. By the end of the Reconquista, Toledo was considered to be the greatest sword-making centre in the world."

 tradition_barb_horses_name: "Barb Horses"
 tradition_barb_horses_desc: "The Barb horse is a northern African breed with great hardiness and stamina and generally possesses a fiery temperament. These prize stallions bore the fierce Berber invaders during the conquest of al-Andalus and became a cornerstone of the elite mounted forces of the Iberian peninsula and beyond."
 
 tradition_nile_agriculture_name: "Nile Agriculture"
 tradition_nile_agriculture_desc: "The Nile River flows from south to north through eastern Africa. It begins in the rivers that flow into Lake Nalubaale, and empties into the Mediterranean Sea more than 6,600 kilometers to the north, making it one of the longest river in the world. The soil of the Nile River delta between El Qâhira (Cairo) and the Mediterranean Sea is rich in nutrients, due to the large silt deposits the Nile leaves behind as it flows into the sea. The banks of the Nile all along its vast length contain rich soil as well, thanks to annual flooding that deposits silt. For thousands of years, much of Egypt's food has been cultivated in the Nile delta region. Ancient Egyptians developed irrigation methods to increase the amount of land they could use for crops and support a thriving population. Canals are used to bring water from the Nile to irrigate farms and support cities. Beans, cotton, wheat, and flax were important and abundant crops that could be easily stored and traded." 

 tradition_dzukijan_horsemen_name: "Dzukijan Horsemen"
 tradition_dzukijan_horsemen_desc: "Dzūkija, as one of the most remote regions of Lithuania, is an excellent place to find strong mounts and hardy people and the Dzukijan Horsemen meet expectations on both counts. Using a bow to engage the enemy at range, these horsemen look to avoid close quarters combat as they most often fight unarmoured."

 tradition_akritai_name: "Akritai"
 tradition_akritai_desc: "The Akritai is a term used in the Byzantine Empire in the 9th–11th centuries to denote the army units guarding the Empire's eastern border, facing the Muslim states of the Middle East. Their exploits, embellished, inspired the Byzantine "national epic" of Digenes Akritas and the cycle of the Acritic songs. These were light infantry recruited from Armenians and the native Byzantine population. By the late 10th century, the reconquest of much territory in the East meant that the latter were often ethnically and religiously mixed, a fact epitomized by the legendary Digenes Akritas - "digenes" means "of two races", i.e. "Roman" (Byzantine/Greek) and "Saracen". The Apelatai, whose role and tactics are described in Nikephoros II Phokas' De velitatione bellica, acted as raiders, scouts and border guards in the perennial border warfare between Byzantium and its eastern neighbors, characterized by skirmishes and raids. Aside from light infantry, the border forces were complemented by the light cavalry called trapezitai. In case of a major Arab raid, they were supposed to raise the alarm, assist in the evacuation of the local population to the various strongholds, and shadow and harass the enemy force until reinforcements could arrive."

 tradition_portage_name: "Portage"
 tradition_portage_desc: "Portage (or portaging) is the practice of carrying water craft or cargo over land, either around an obstacle in a river or between two bodies of water. A path where items are regularly carried between bodies of water is also called a portage. In the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries, Viking merchant-adventurers exploited a network of waterways in Eastern Europe, with portages connecting the four most important rivers of the region: the Volga, Western Dvina, Dnieper, and Don. The portages of what is now Russia were vital for the Varangian commerce with the Orient and Constantinople. At the most important portages there were trade outposts inhabited by a mixture of Norse merchants and native population. The Khazars built the fortress of Sarkel to guard a key portage between the Volga and the Don. After Varangian and Khazar power in Eastern Europe waned, Slavic merchants continued to use the portages along the Volga trade route and the Dnieper trade route."

 tradition_eyres_name: "Eyres"
 tradition_eyres_desc: "An eyre or iter was the name of a circuit travelled by an itinerant justice in medieval England (a justice in eyre), or the circuit court over which they presided, or the right of the monarch (or justices acting in their name) to visit and inspect the holdings of any vassal. The eyre involved visits and inspections at irregular intervals of the houses of vassals in the kingdom. The term is derived from Old French erre, from Latin iter ("journey"), and is cognate with errand and errant. Eyres were also held in those parts of Ireland under secure English rule."

 tradition_assizes_ariano_name: "Assizes of Ariano"
 tradition_assizes_ariano_desc: "The Assizes of Ariano were a series of laws for the Kingdom of Sicily promulgated in the summer of 1140 at Ariano, near Benevento, by Roger II of Sicily. Having recently pacified the peninsula, constantly in revolt, he had decided to make a move to more centralised government. The assizes established the large Sicilian bureaucracy and sought to maintain the feudal system under strict royal control. It contained forty clauses that touched on all possible topics of contemporary legal concern: private property, public property, the church, civil law, royal finances, and the military. The work was advanced for its day, deriving its precepts not only from Norman and French, but also Muslim and Byzantine (especially Justinian) legal theories.\n\nThe Assizes affirm that the king is the only lawgiver in Sicily, that he is both judge and priest (as he holds the legatine powers from the pope), and all Sicilians were equal and under the same laws, whether Latin, Greek, Norman, Lombard, Arab, Jew, or Muslim. It punished treason with death. It was also detailed in other crimes of violence - cowardice in battle, arming a mob, or withholding support from the king or his allies. Ecclesiastically, Christian heretics and apostates lost their rights. Bishops were excused from attendance at courts, though the king was granted override on this, as on everything, and there could be no appeals. Militarily, the knightly class was closed. Nobody could become a knight if had no knightly lineage. Finally, the assizes did not ignore the commoners and demanded that they be treated with justice and be burdened not unduly by their lords."

 tradition_pravda_russkaya_name: "Pravda Rusĭskaya"
 tradition_pravda_russkaya_desc: "Pravda Rusĭskaya (Rus' Justice or Rus' Truth) was the legal code of Kievan Rus' and the subsequent Rus' principalities during the times of feudal division. It was written at the beginning of the 12th century and remade during many centuries. The basis of the Pravda Rusĭskaya, Pravda of Yaroslav, was written at the beginning of the 11th century. Pravda Rusĭskaya was a main source of Old Russian Law. Pravda Rusĭskaya’s legal regulations reflected the evolution of the social relations in the Rus' of the 11th-13th centuries. Common law, Knyaz legislation, and legal proceedings represented the basis of the Pravda Rusĭskaya. It also reflected social relations which were common among other closely related slavic nations, such as Croats and White Croats, and from roughly same time period, the Poljica Statute in Croatia emerged which is remarkably similar in content to Pravda Rus'skaya."

 tradition_outremer_armies_name: "Armies of the Outremer"
 tradition_outremer_armies_desc: "For the nearly ninety years, between the founding of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the defeat of the Christian army at Hattin in July 1187, the armies of “Outremer” were substantial, surprisingly effective, and nominally feudal. The survival of the Crusader States depends almost entirely on their military capabilities, and as such all vassals under 60 years of age are expected to serve mounted and fully armed whenever summoned by the King of Jerusalem."

 tradition_mudejar_art_name: "Mudéjar Art"
 tradition_mudejar_art_desc: "Mudéjar art, also known as Mudéjar style, refers to a type of ornamentation and decoration used in the Iberian Christian kingdoms, primarily between the 13th and 16th centuries. It was applied to Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance architectural styles that incorporated elaborate geometric designs and patterning as constructive, ornamental, and decorative motifs derived from those that had been brought to or developed in Islamic Iberia or Al-Andalus. It is thought to have begun with Muslim craftsmen who applied traditional constructive, ornamental, and decorative elements derived from the Islamic arts to Christian styles of architecture. These methods became part of local Christian building traditions and were applied to Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance architectural styles in the expanding Christian kingdoms of Iberia. These decorative techniques included calligraphy, intricate geometry, and vegetal forms derived from Islamic art and architecture."

 tradition_exechequer_name: "Exchequer"
 tradition_exechequer_desc: "The Exchequer, which was named after a table used to perform calculations for taxes and goods in the medieval period, was a government office responsible for collecting revenue and making payments on behalf of the sovereign, auditing official accounts, and trying legal cases relating to revenue. It is unknown exactly when the Exchequer was established, but the earliest mention appears in a royal writ of 1110 during the reign of King Henry I. Similar offices were later created in Normandy around 1180, in Scotland around 1200 and in Ireland in 1210."

 tradition_fatimid_royal_guard_name: "Royal Guard"
 tradition_fatimid_royal_guard_desc: "We have a long tradition of a standing army made to protect the capital and its sovereign. This has given us access to tough soldiers that work well with supporting troops. This includes the Khassaki, who are the Sultan's own elite troops. Given the best horses and equipment, the Khassaki are fiercely loyal and are the only troops allowed to carry weapons at all times. Besides ceremonial duties, these hardened warriors are charged with protecting the Sultan while on campaigns, as well as often taking on the most important missions or tasks within the Sultan's army. The second core unit of the guard is the Tabardariyya who guard the Sultan and the palace. They are armed with a large axe, 'tabar', which is similar to a traditional Scandinavian axe. These well armoured, elite troops are formidable on the battle field too."
 
 tradition_islamic_furusiyya_name: "Furūsiyya"
 tradition_islamic_furusiyya_desc: "Furūsiyya is the historical Arabic term for knightly martial exercise during the Middle Ages, during the Crusades and Mamluk period in particular, especially concerned with the martial arts and equestrianism of the Golden Age of Islam. The body of Arabo-Persian "Furūsiyya literature" includes the genre Faras-nāma, which is an encyclopedic compilation of facts relating to horses.\n\nIt was a concept and noble art that included the arts of war and hunting, equestrianism, tactics and strategy, and certain games like chess. This art was practiced throughout the Muslim world, and saw its greatest achievement in Mamluk Egypt during the 14th century. It was part of a larger regional phenomenon of Western Eurasia that included European knighthood of the time.\n\nHowever, furūsiyya also appears to have retained a wider meaning of "the continuing ethos of manly endeavor of early Islam", comparable to the contemporary European notion of chivalry. Islamic furussiya and European chivalry has both influenced each other as a means of a warrior code for the knights of both cultures."
 
 tradition_kulgrinda_name: "Kūlgrindos"
 tradition_kulgrinda_desc: "Kūlgrinda (from the Samogitian kūlis 'stone' and grinda 'pavement', itself from grįsti 'to rake, pull together') is a hidden underwater stony road or ford across swamps and swampy areas used for defense in the history of Lithuania. Similar secret roads made primarily of wood and ground were known as medgrinda (from medis, 'tree') and žemgrinda (from žemė, 'earth, ground') respectively.\n\nUndetectable from the surface, these roads were usually known only to the locals, and as such were an important element of the defense against various invaders, including the Teutonic Knights in the 13–14th centuries. Kūlgrindas provided a safe shortcut between villages, hillforts, and other defensive structures. They were built by bringing stones, wood, or gravel over frozen swamps in the winter and letting them sink once the ice melted. Such procedure would be repeated several times. Sometimes wooden posts were inserted to protect the elevated area from washing away."
 
 tradition_professional_army_name: "Professional Army"
 tradition_professional_army_desc: "This culture forsakes the idea of calling on the untrained masses to fight its' wars, preferring to field a smaller but highly-trained and well-equipped force."
 
 tradition_military_engineering_name: "Military Engineering"
 tradition_military_engineering_desc: "This culture has dedicated itself to the study of designing and constructing more effective military fortifications and weapons of war. Unfortunately for any who oppose them, this knowledge also allows them great insight on how best to topple any structure that stands in their way."
 
 tradition_fierce_independence_name: "Vlach Migrators"
 tradition_fierce_independence_desc: "The Vlachs have long been a nomadic people comprised of shepherds and muleteers, caring little for whatever powers travel through their lands. That is, until one such power would seek to control them, in which case one would soon learn that Vlachs are not so easily controlled."
 
 tradition_african_agriculture_name: "Ifriqiyan Irrigation"
 tradition_african_agriculture_desc: "Once called the "granary of the empire," North Africa (also known as Ifriqiya) was one of the largest exporters of grain during the time of the Roman Empire. Grain was not the region's only product with other crops including fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. This was done through the construction and upkeep of large-scale irrigation systems fed largely by aqueducts that would collect and transport water throughout the region. Though much of the irrigation infrastructure suffered following the decline of Roman Africa and the rule of the Vandalic kingdom, the Islamic Conquest of North Africa returned a measure of stability that allowed the region to flourish once more. Under Islamic dynasties such as the Aghlabids, extensive improvements were made to the pre-existing water works in order to promote olive groves and other agriculture, to irrigate royal gardens, and for livestock. Roman aqueducts to supply the towns with water were rebuilt, expanded, and replicated across Ifriqiya. In the Kairouan region hundreds of basins were constructed to store water for the raising of horses."
 
 tradition_merc_armies_name: "Contracted Armies"
 tradition_merc_armies_desc: "Why risk the life and limb of our own people when we are perfectly able to hire others to do that for us. It is far better to hire so-called 'professional soldiers' to do our fighting while we focus on what is truly important."

 tradition_norman_traditions_name: "Blood of the North"
 tradition_norman_traditions_desc: "The Normans are noted both for their culture, such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions, and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations. Norman adventurers played a role in founding the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after briefly conquering southern Italy and Malta from the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the historic Battle of Hastings in 1066. Norman and Anglo-Norman forces contributed to the Iberian Reconquista from the early eleventh to the mid-thirteenth centuries.\n\nNorman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands. The legacy of the Normans persists today through the regional languages and dialects of France, England, Spain, Quebec and Sicily, and also through the various cultural, judicial, and political arrangements they introduced in their conquered territories."
