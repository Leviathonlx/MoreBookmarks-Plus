 innovation_age_grade_associations:0 "Age-grade Associations" 
 innovation_age_grade_associations_desc: "The division of society into age grades, often gender-separated â€“ is often marked by an initiation rite, which may be the crowning of a long and complex preparation, sometimes in retreat. After a period of some years, during which they often perform certain common activities, such as policing in the community, or construction of new dwellings. Under senior guidance, members of age-grade may be initiated either collectively or individually into a more senior age grade. This progression is often accompanied by the revelation of secret knowledge. In most cultures, age grade systems, as with age sets, are the preserve of men, and it is the older men who control a society's secret knowledge, collectively or restricted to a council of elders and/or specific positions such as shaman entrusted with the preparation of initiation rites."
