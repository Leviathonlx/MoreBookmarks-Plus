 innovation_nubianization: "Nubianization"
 innovation_nubianization_desc: "During the 11th-century the kingdoms of Nubia went through a process of Nubianization, like the Kushites before them the Nubians adeptly absorbed and adapted foreign influences, synthesizing these influences with their own culture to create new unique forms of language, titular, and religion. One of the main initiators of this process of active Nubianization of courtly life has been suggested to have been Georgios, the archbishop of Dongola and hence the head of the Makurian church. He seems to have popularized the Nubian language as the written language to replace Nubian Greek, and counter the growing influence of Arabic in the Coptic Church of Egypt. Also introduced were more indigenous influences on the church such as the cult of dead rulers and bishops, as well as indigenous Nubian saints."

Under senior guidance, members of age-grade may be initiated either collectively or individually into a more senior age grade. This progression is often accompanied by the revelation of secret knowledge. In most cultures, age grade systems, as with age sets, are the preserve of men, and it is the older men who control a society's secret knowledge, collectively or restricted to a council of elders and/or specific positions such as shaman entrusted with the preparation of initiation rites."

 innovation_military_manuals: "Byzantine Military Manuals"
 innovation_military_manuals_desc: "One of the most symbolic qualities of the Byzantine military as it developed was the use of so-called military manuals. Primarily aimed at preserving and proliferating sophisticated military doctrine to army officers and commanders, these treatises played a formidable role in retaining the Byzantine military as one of the most formidable, organized, and disciplined forces of war throughout the Medieval period. The use of such manuals continued a tradition of the Greco-Roman study of warfare and tacticians that stretched back to Xenophon and Aeneas Tacticus, with late Hellenistic military manuals adapted and applied for the needs and realities of the Byzantine army, most of them deriving from the wide corpus of ancient Greek and late Hellenistic authors, especially Aelian, Onasander, and Polyaenus, and to a lesser extent Aeneas and Arrian. The most famous of these manuals is The Strategikon, attributed to the Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) and was likely compiled in the late sixth century. Describing in detail weaponry and armor, daily life on the march or in camp, clothing, food, medical care, military law, and titles of the Byzantine army of the seventh century, the Strategikon offers insights into the Byzantine military ethos and exercised a profound influence upon the subsequent Byzantine genre."
 
 innovation_stirrups: "Stirrup"
 innovation_stirrups_desc: "A stirrup is a light frame or ring that holds the foot of a rider, attached to the saddle by a strap, often called a stirrup leather. Stirrups are usually paired and are used to aid in mounting and as a support while using a riding animal (usually a horse or other equine, such as a mule). They greatly increase the rider's ability to stay in the saddle and control the mount, increasing the animal's usefulness to humans in areas such as communication, transportation, and warfare. By the late 6th or early 7th century AD, primarily due to invaders from Central Asia, such as the Avars, stirrups began spreading across Asia to Europe from China. From there the stirrup was erratically adopted by European states across the following three centuries.\n\nThe introduction of the stirrup not only made the mounted warrior supreme in medieval warfare, but may have initiated complex and far-reaching social and cultural changes in Europe. Some scholars credit the birth of feudalism and its subsequent spread into Northern Italy, Spain, Germany and into the Slavic territories to this use of the stirrup. It is argued that the rising feudal class structure of the European Middle Ages derived ultimately from the use of stirrups - 'Few inventions have been so simple as the stirrup, but few have had so catalytic an influence on history. The requirements of the new mode of warfare which it made possible found expression in a new form of western European society dominated by an aristocracy of warriors endowed with land so that they might fight in a new and highly specialized way.'"
 
 innovation_post_roman_britons: "Sub-Roman Legacy"
 innovation_post_roman_britons_desc: "We [romano_briton|E] once inhabited the whole of Britannia, but ever since the Irish and Saxons settled on our shores, we have been steadily pushed back towards the fringes of the isle. \n\nAlthough the [anglo_saxon|E] now control the fertile lowlands to the east, we have survived, and we have adapted. We will not bow to foreign invaders, and we will fight to preserve our independence! One day we shall reclaim our native lands, but until then, we will let our enemies know that we are not easily subdued!"
 
 # innovation_justinian_code: "Corpus Juris Civilis"
 # innovation_justinian_code_desc: "The Justinian Code or Corpus Juris Civilis (Corpus of Civil Law) was a major reform of Byzantine law created by Emperor Justinian I (r. 527-565 CE) in 528-9 CE. Aiming to clarify and update the old Roman laws, eradicate inconsistencies, and speed up legal processes, the collection of imperial edicts and expert opinions covered all manner of topics from punishments for specific crimes to marriage and the inheritance of property. Not only used as a basis for Byzantine law for over 900 years, the laws therein continue to influence many western legal systems to this day."
 
 innovation_hindu_numeral_system: "Hindu Numeral System"
 innovation_hindu_numeral_system_desc: "The Hindu numeral system is a positional decimal numeral system, and is the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world. It was invented between the 1st and 4th centuries by Indian mathematicians. The system is based upon ten (originally nine) glyphs. The symbols (glyphs) used to represent the system are in principle independent of the system itself. The glyphs in actual use are descended from Brahmi numerals and have split into various typographical variants since the Middle Ages."
 
 innovation_bulgarian_army: "Medieval Bulgarian Army"
 innovation_bulgarian_army_desc: "The medieval Bulgarian army was the primary military body of the First and the Second Bulgarian Empires, and some Puppet states of the former, like the Despotate of Dobruja. During the first decades after the foundation of the country, the army consisted of a Bulgar cavalry and a Slavic infantry. The core of the Bulgarian army was the heavy cavalry, which consisted of ca. 12,000 heavily armed riders. At its height in the 9th and 10th centuries, it was one of the most formidable military forces in Europe and was feared by its enemies. There are several documented cases of Byzantine commanders abandoning an invasion because of a reluctance to confront the Bulgarian army on its home territory."
 
 innovation_caravanserai: "Caravanserai"
 innovation_caravanserai_desc: "A caravanserai was a roadside inn where travelers could rest and recover from the day's journey. Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information, and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa and Southeast Europe, most notably the Silk Road. Although many were located along rural roads in the countryside, urban versions of caravanserais were also historically common in cities throughout the Islamic world. Urban caravanserais also became important centers of economic activity in cities across different regions of the Muslim world, often concentrated near the main souq areas, with many examples still standing in the historic areas of Damascus, Aleppo, Cairo, Istanbul, and Fes. In many parts of the Muslim world, caravanserais also provided revenues that were used to fund charitable or religious functions or buildings. These revenues and functions were managed through a waqf, a protected agreement which gave certain buildings and revenues the status of mortmain endowments guaranteed under Islamic law."
 
 innovation_shotel: "Shotel"
 innovation_shotel_desc: "A shotel is a curved sword originating in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Its shape is similar to a large sickle and can be effectively used to reach around an opponent's shield and stab them in vital areas, such as the kidneys or lungs. Shotel techniques among others included hooking attacks both against mounted and dismounted opponents that had devastating effect especially against mounted cavalry as the shotel could be used to hook and rip the warrior off the horse."
 
 innovation_muslim_jinete: "Granadine Jinetes"
 innovation_muslim_jinete_desc: "Descendants of Moors who settled in Iberia. These lightly armoured skirmishers are capable of forming a circle formation that provides constant fire against the enemy. They use their speed to stay out of harm's way until they can hurl their javelins, then close in when the enemy is sufficiently weakened."
 
 innovation_french_caballarii: "Caballarii"
 innovation_french_caballarii_desc: "The vast majority of the Frankish troops during the Carolingian dynasty were simply infantry spearmen – the Franks having long before abandoned their traditional 'francisca' throwing ax – but the king did maintain an elite mounted contingent of heavy cavalr: the famed caballarius. Initially these caballarii were housed in or near the palace, but in time spread among the greater landed magnates as well. Whereas most of the troops were merely levies called up in time of war, the caballarius were “professionals,” and even provided temporary leaders for the less well-trained Frankish units. Divided into 'scara' (non-standardized regiments), the caballarii of Charlemagne seem to have been divided into three ranks of prestige, with the 'scholares' being the king’s personal bodyguard. The caballarii could, it seems, be used as true shock troops when mounted, or could dismount and fight on foot. And proved quite effective in either case."
 
 #Early Medieval
 innovation_heavy_plough: "Carruca"
 innovation_heavy_plough_desc: "The carruca was a kind of heavy plow important to the development of medieval agriculture in Northern Europe. The carruca used a heavy iron plowshare to turn heavy soil and may have required a team of eight oxen. Prior to the introduction of the heavy plow into Northern Europe, it was impossible to take proper advantage of the fertile clay soils. Research suggests that the adoption of the carruca into Northern Europe was responsible for a sizable degree of the unprecedented productivity growth and urbanization that occured from the 900s to 1300s."
 
 innovation_hindu_arabic_numeral: "Hindu–Arabic Numeral System"
 innovation_hindu_arabic_numeral_desc: "The Hindu–Arabic numeral system or Indo-Arabic numeral system (also called the Arabic numeral system or Hindu numeral system) is a positional decimal numeral system, and is the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world. It was invented between the 1st and 4th centuries by Indian mathematicians. The system was adopted in Arabic mathematics by the 9th century. Influential were the books of Persian Al-Khwārizmī (On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, c.825) and Al-Kindi (On the Use of the Hindu Numerals, c.830). The system later spread to medieval Europe by the High Middle Ages. The system is based upon ten (originally nine) glyphs. The symbols (glyphs) used to represent the system are in principle independent of the system itself. The glyphs in actual use are descended from Brahmi numerals and have split into various typographical variants since the Middle Ages. These symbol sets can be divided into three main families: Western Arabic numerals used in the Greater Maghreb and in Europe, Eastern Arabic numerals used in the Middle East, and the Indian numerals in various scripts used in the Indian subcontinent."
 
 innovation_bimaristan: "Bimaristan"
 innovation_bimaristan_desc: "A bimaristan is a hospital in the historic Islamic world, whose purpose was to serve as a designated place where medical treatment could be given to individuals in need. In Islamic culture, bimaristans served all people regardless of their race, religion, citizenship, or gender. The goal of all physicians and hospital staff was to work together to help the well-being of their patients. There were no restrictions on the time a patient could spend as an inpatient as bimaristans were required to keep all patients until they were fully recovered. Hospital wards were divided into mental disease, contagious disease, non-contagious disease, surgery, medicine, and eye disease. Each hospital could contain a lecture hall, kitchen, pharmacy, library, mosque, and occasionally a chapel for Christian patients. Recreational materials and musicians were often employed to comfort and cheer patients up."
 
 innovation_acequia: "Acequia"
 innovation_acequia_desc: "Acequia, adapted from the Arabic word “al-asaqiya” meaning 'the canal' or 'the waterway', is a community-operated watercourse. The Arabic-speaking Moors of North Africa brought the term and the technology to Spain during their settlement of the Iberian peninsula. Acequias are gravity-fed irrigation canals; and as such they do not require pumps or pipes and instead rely on the positive flow of water down slope, with the primary water source being snow runoff or river water. The flow of water can be redirected through a number of channels to distant fields through the use of gates."
 
 innovation_fatimid_meritocracy: "Meritocratic Administration"
 innovation_fatimid_meritocracy_desc: "Unlike western European governments of the era, advancement in Fatimid state offices was more meritocratic than hereditary. Members of other branches of Islam, like the Sunnis, were just as likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance was extended to non-Muslims, such as Christians and Jews, who occupied high levels in government based on their ability, and this policy of tolerance ensured the flow of money from non-Muslims in order to finance the Caliphs' large army."
 
 innovation_islamic_naffatun: "Naphtha"
 innovation_islamic_naffatun_desc: "Naphtha is a mixture of chemicals that become a fiery liquid that is difficult to put out. These men throw deadly ceramic pots of flaming Naphtha that burst into flames on impact spilling a sticky molten mess that can seep through any armour. The prospect of a fiery death can unnerve even the bravest warrior."
 
 innovation_berber_adarga: "Adarga"
 innovation_berber_adarga_desc: "The adarga was a hard leather shield created by the north-african Berbers, its name derived from the Arabic "al-daraqa" ("shield"). An important center of manufacture of the adarga was the city of Fes, Morocco. The adarga was typically made from the hide of the antelope (probably the Arabian Oryx) and was extremely resistant to the blows of sword, lance, javelin, and arrow, but other kinds of leather were used as well. Inside, in the center, was a pair of leather grips held in the hand or strapped to the forearm with a small cushion beneath to absorb impact. Originally the adarga was round, then heart shaped, then finally it took the form of a pair of overlapping ellipses or ovals, measuring 69–80 cm in the long axis. Two or more layers of hide were glued and sewn together to make the adarga both rigid and elastic, and often decorated with incised and gilt ornaments, Moorish inscriptions, and metal appliques and borders. The adarga was a traditional defense employed by the Moorish light horseman, who used it along with the lance."
 
 innovation_cossack_cavalry: "Cossack Cavalry"
 innovation_cossack_cavalry_desc: "Russian Cossacks spend much of their time on horseback, and as such are accustomed to the tasks of guarding and protecting towns, roads, forts and settlements. Renown for their bravery and hardiness, Cossacks are equipped with a sword and composite bow which they use from horseback."
 
 innovation_turkish_sipahi: "Sipahi"
 innovation_turkish_sipahi_desc: "Sipahi were professional cavalrymen deployed by the Seljuks, and later two types of Ottoman cavalry corps, including the fief-holding provincial timarli sipahi, which constituted most of the army, and the regular kapikulu sipahi, palace troops. The sipahi acted as shock cavalrym wielding bows, javelins, and most noteably, a lance."
 
 innovation_welsh_helwyr: "Helwyr"
 innovation_welsh_helwyr_desc: "Drawn from the local population, Helwyr are skilled hunters who have little experience in the ways of war. Whilst unarmoured and equipped with weaponry better suited to hunting game, when called upon to engage the enemy in close quarters or at range, these men are capable of fighting with a determination that belays their lack of formal training."
 
 innovation_nomadic_tribesmen: "Nomadic Tribesmen"
 innovation_nomadic_tribesmen_desc: "The Fatimid military was based largely on the Kutama Berber tribesmen brought along on the march to Egypt, and they remained an important part of the military even after Tunisia began to break away. A fundamental change occurred when the Fatimid Caliphate attempted to push into Syria in the latter half of the 10th century. The Fatimids were faced with the now Turkish-dominated forces of the Abbasid Caliphate and began to realize the limits of their current military. Thus during the reign of Abu Mansur Nizar al-Aziz Billah and Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Caliph began incorporating armies of Turks and, later, black Africans (even later, other groups such as Armenians were also used). The army units were generally separated along ethnic lines: the Berbers were usually the light cavalry and foot skirmishers, while the Turks were the horse archers or heavy cavalry (known as Mamluks). The black Africans, Syrians, and Arabs generally acted as the heavy infantry and foot archers. This ethnic-based army system, along with the partial slave status of many of the imported ethnic fighters, would remain fundamentally unchanged in Egypt for many centuries after the fall of the Fatimid Caliphate."

 innovation_wheelbarrow: "Wheelbarrow"
 innovation_wheelbarrow_desc: "A wheelbarrow is a small hand-propelled vehicle, usually with just one wheel, designed to be pushed and guided by a single person using two handles at the rear. The wheelbarrow is designed to distribute the weight of its load between the wheel and the operator, so enabling the convenient carriage of heavier and bulkier loads than would be possible were the weight carried entirely by the operator. The first wheelbarrows in medieval Europe appeared sometime between 1170 and 1250, though research on the early history of the wheelbarrow is made difficult by the marked absence of a common terminology. By the 13th century, the wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. However, going by surviving documents and illustrations the wheelbarrow remained a relative rarity until the 15th century and seemed limited to England, France, and the Low Countries."
 
 innovation_genoese_crossbowmen: "Genoese Crossbowmen"
 innovation_genoese_crossbowmen_desc: "The Genoese crossbowmen (Italian: Balestrieri genovesi) was a famous military corps of the Middle Ages, which acted both in defence of the Republic of Genoa and as a mercenary force for other Italian or European powers. The main armament of the Genoese crossbowmen was the crossbow, made in Genoa by the Balistrai Corporation. As well, the mercenaries were equipped with a dagger, a light metal helmet, a gorget, a hauberk and a large shield, called a pavise, which was used while reloading the crossbow. The usual team consisted of a crossbowman and two assistants, one supporting the pavise, the other responsible for spanning a second bow, thus doubling the rate of fire. The Genoese crossbowmen came to prominence during the First Crusade, when the Genoese commander Guglielmo Embriaco used the corps in the course of the siege of Jerusalem, and again at the Battle of Jaffa in 1192 during the Third Crusade. The Genoese crossbowmen remained one of the most respected military corps until the 16th century, well after the introduction of black-powder weapons in Europe."
 
 innovation_hyperpyron: "Hyperpyron"
 innovation_hyperpyron_desc: "The hyperpyron was a Byzantine coin in use during the late Middle Ages, replacing the solidus as the Byzantine Empire's gold coinage. The traditional gold currency of the Byzantine Empire had been the solidus or nomisma, whose gold content had remained steady at 24 carats for seven centuries and was consequently highly prized. From the 1030s, however, the coin was increasingly debased, until in the 1080s, following the military disasters and civil wars of the previous decade, its gold content was reduced to almost zero. Consequently, in 1092, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) undertook a drastic overhaul of the Byzantine coinage system and introduced a new gold coin, the hyperpyron (meaning "super-refined"). This was of the same standard weight as the solidus, but of less gold content due to the recycling of earlier debased coins. The hyperpyron remained the standard gold coin until gold coins ceased to be minted by the Byzantines in the mid-14th century."

Armoured in plate and wielding lances and swords these units are determined to defend their lord's honour and fight for his interests, whatever they are."
 
 innovation_voulge: "Voulge"
 innovation_voulge_desc: "The voulge is a polearm related to simple harvesting tools but turned into a weapon of war. Superficially, a voulge might strongly resemble a glaive, but there are some notable differences in construction. First, the attachment of the voulge blade to the shaft was usually done by binding the lower two thirds of the blade to the side of the pole; the glaive would often have a socket built into the blade itself and was mounted on top of the pole. In addition, while both had curved blades, that of the voulge was broad and meant for hacking, while that of the glaive was narrow and meant more for cutting. A voulge thus looks something like a squashed bardiche, or just a meat cleaver attached to a long pole. Troops that used the weapon are called voulgiers. Having a large, slightly curved slashing blade on the top, this weapon in the hands of Voulgiers can deliver severe and oft fatal wounds to any unfortunate victims. This weapon is effective against infantry and cavalry."

From necessity, following extensive territorial loss and a near disastrous defeat by the Normans of southern Italy at Dyrrachion in 1081, Alexios constructed a new army from the ground up. This new army was significantly different from previous forms of the Byzantine army, especially in the methods used for the recruitment and maintenance of soldiers. The army was characterised by an increased reliance on the military capabilities of the immediate imperial household, the relatives of the ruling dynasty, and the provincial Byzantine aristocracy. Another distinctive element of the new army was an expansion of the employment of foreign mercenary troops and their organisation into more permanent units. However, continuity in equipment, unit organisation, tactics and strategy from earlier times is evident. The Komnenian army was instrumental in creating the territorial integrity and stability that allowed the Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine Empire. It was deployed in the Balkans, Italy, Hungary, Russia, Anatolia, Syria, the Holy Land and Egypt."
 
 innovation_ducat_trade_coin: "Ducat Trade Coin"
 innovation_ducat_trade_coin_desc: "The ducat coin was used as a trade coin in Europe from the later Middle Ages from the 13th to 19th centuries. The word ducat is from Medieval Latin ducalis = "relating to a duke (or dukedom)", and initially meant "duke's coin" or a "duchy's coin". The first issue of scyphate billon coins modelled on Byzantine trachea was made by King Roger II of Sicily as part of the Assizes of Ariano. It was to be a valid issue for the whole kingdom. Though the coin later failed, it served as inspiration for the Venetian Ducat that was introduced just a few decades later."
 
 innovation_danish_svenner: "Svenner"
 innovation_danish_svenner_desc: "The expense required to train a knight often prohibits a General from deploying as much cavalary as he might otherwise prefer. In these cases Svenner, or "squires", may be called upon to fight alongside their masters. Whilst they are no match for professional knights, the advantage provided by even inexperienced cavalary can be enough to turn a battle."
 
 innovation_mongol_cataphract: "Mongol Lancer"
 innovation_mongol_cataphract_desc: "Six of every ten Mongol troopers were light cavalry horse archers; the remaining four were more heavily armored and armed lancers. In field battles the Mongols typically showered their enemy with armor-piercing arrows paving the way for a cavalry charge in which swift-moving horsemen hacked down survivors with hooked lances. There were few armies that could oppose the combination of these forces in open combat."

 innovation_yassa: "Yassa"
 innovation_yassa_desc: "Yassa was the oral law code of the Mongols declared in public in Bokhara by Genghis Khan and acted as the de facto law of the Mongol Empire even though the "law" was kept secret and never made public. The Yassa seems to have its origin as wartime decrees, which were later codified and expanded to include cultural and lifestyle conventions. By keeping the Yassa secret, the decrees could be modified and used selectively. It is believed that the Yassa was supervised by Genghis Khan himself and his stepbrother Shikhikhutag, then the high judge of the Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan appointed his second son, Chagatai, to oversee the laws' execution. Ogedei Khan, the third son of Genghis Khan and the second Great Khan, proclaimed the Great Yassa as an integral body of precedents, confirming the continuing validity of his father's commands and ordinances and added his own. Ogedei codified rules of dress, conduct of the kurultais, the military council. His two immediate successors followed the tradition of the Yassa."
 
 innovation_pavise: "Pavise"
 innovation_pavise_desc: "A pavise was an oblong shield used during the late 14th to early 16th centuries. Often large enough to cover the entire body, it was used by archers, crossbowmen, and other infantry soldiers. Of European origin, the pavise was large, square and convex. A smaller version for hand-to-hand combat and for wearing on the backs of men-at-arms was also made. The pavise is characterized by its prominent central ridge. The pavise was primarily used by archers and crossbowmen in the Middle Ages, particularly during sieges. It was carried by a pavisier, usually an archer, or, especially for the larger ones, by a specialist pavise-bearer. The pavise was held in place by the pavisier or sometimes deployed in the ground with a spike attached to the bottom. While reloading their weapons, archers and crossbowmen would crouch behind them to shelter against incoming missile attacks."

These nobles were previously part of the contingent assigned with border guard duties in the periphery of the conquered territories in the region. In the thirteenth century, some of these groups were officially integrated into the Hungarian nobility. They received their privileges from King Béla IV of Hungary in 1243. They were obliged to equip ten knights or lancers. They were not subject to the authority of the ispán (or head) of Szepes County and tax was collected from them only if the "royal servants" (or noblemen) were also required to pay it. Initially, they formed about 40 families, but their number decreased to less than 20 families by the 16th century. They lost their special status in 1804."

 innovation_pavise_spearmen: "Pavise Spearmen"
 innovation_pavise_spearmen_desc: "Many of these Pavise Spearmen are made up of Hungary's 'Jobbagy', holders of a small fiefdom, serving their military duty as infantry because they are too impoverished to own or equip a horse.

 innovation_spanish_jinete_desc: "As a military term, jinete means a Spanish light horseman that wore leather armor and were armed with javelins, a spear, a sword, and a shield. They were a type of mounted troop developed in the early Middle Ages in response to the massed light cavalry of the Moors. Often fielded in significant numbers by the Spanish, and at times the most numerous of the Spanish mounted troops, they played an important role in Spanish mounted warfare throughout the Reconquista until the sixteenth century. Their tactics were not to close but to hover round their opponents, continually harassing them till they should give ground or break their formation, when a chance would occur of pushing a charge home. They were to swarm around the enemy, to overwhelm him with darts, then to draw off if the enemy charged in mass and hang upon his flanks then charge him when he grew tired, or fell into disorder."
 
 innovation_iberian_pikes: "Iberian Pikemen"
 innovation_iberian_pikes_desc: "In combat, pikemen fought in very close lines, forming a square with their weapons pointing out like a gigantic hedgehog. In the Late Middle Ages, Iberian pikemen served in two large groups, always fighting in close order, where their formation gave them the advantage. In the first rows were the armoured pikemen - the elite - as they were equipped with basic defensive armour, called coseletes, after the armour they wore. The other group was formed by the light pikemen, who had no other defensive armour than a helmet, were called picas secas - dry pikes."
 
 innovation_portugal_crossbowmen: "Besteiros do conto"
 innovation_portugal_crossbowmen_desc: "Throughout their existence as a military force, the besteiros do conto played a fundamental role in the battles fought by the Portuguese Crown. The recruitment of  men for this militia was to be made from among the artisans, preferably those who were married and did not till the land on a permanent basis with a yoke of oxen. Armed with crossbows, these soldiers were endowed with a deadly accuracy and a highly destructive shooting capacity. It is believed that they first began to be organized in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries by Dom Dinis or Dom Afonso IV."
 
 innovation_irish_galloglaigh: "Gall óglaigh"
 innovation_irish_galloglaigh_desc: "The gall óglaigh ("foreign warriors") were a class of elite mercenary warriors who were principally members of the Norse-Gaelic clans of Ireland between the mid 13th century and late 16th century. Originally applied to Scots, who shared a common background and language with the Irish, but as they were descendants of 10th century Norse settlers who had intermarried with the local population in western Scotland, the Irish called them Gall Gaeil ("foreign Gaels"). The gall óglaigh were attractive as heavily armoured, trained infantry to be relied upon as a strong defence for holding a position, unlike most Irish foot soldiers, who were less well armoured than the typical Irish noble who fought as cavalry. Soon most gall óglaigh were native Irish and the term came to mean a type of warrior, rather than any ethnic designation."
 
 innovation_irish_ceithern: "Ceithern"
 innovation_irish_ceithern_desc: "Ceithern, meaning "warband", make up the bulk of the infantry in Irish armies. Readily recruited from towns and villages, these Gaelic soliders work well when deployed in tandem with the heavier Galloglaigh.

 innovation_gaelic_ceathairne: "Ceathairne"
 innovation_gaelic_ceathairne_desc: "The Gaelic word ‘ceathairne’ is used to refer to a band of armed peasants from the Scottish highlands. Literally, the word means ‘battle man’ – a warrior.

 innovation_sofa: "Sofa"
 innovation_sofa_desc: "Sofa is a Mandinka term for slave soldiers who served in the army of the Mali Empire. Sofas make their first appearance in oral and written records during the formation of the Mali Empire. Sofas were recruited from "jonow" (slaves) captured in battle or bought from afar. They could be depended on in most instances for obedience, since their livelihood depended entirely on their master. The institution of slavery in the Mali Empire heavily rewarded loyalty, and jonow could rise to civil or military positions of prominence. Jonow became part of their master's clan, and were often freed after a certain number of years. As part of the clan, jonow were expected to accompany their master's into battle and handle his horse and weapons. Initially forbidden from engaging in direct warfare, sofa eventually made up the majority of Mali's infantry army. As infantry, they were armed with bows and arrows by the state or, more accurately, royal clans devoted to the state. Sofas were equipped with two quivers, and their bow was small by European standards. It could not fire very far or even powerfully, so sofas utilized deadly poisons and fired in arcs to give the arrows strength. Sofas also used flaming arrows, especially against fortifications that were often little more than thatch or wooden palisades."
 
 innovation_irish_horseboys: "Horseboys"
 innovation_irish_horseboys_desc: "Horseboys, whilst typically acting as squires for Irish Nobles, are also capable fighters themselves.

 innovation_yeoman_archers: "Yeoman Archers"
 innovation_yeoman_archers_desc: "The Yeoman Archer is a term applied specifically to English and Welsh military longbow archers (either mounted or on foot) of the 14th-15th centuries. Yeoman archers were commoners; free-born members of the social classes below the nobility and gentry. They were a product of the English form of feudalism in which the military duty of a knight to his lord (which was implicit in tenure feudalism) was replaced by paid, short-term service. By negating the tactical advantage of large numbers of cavalry (mounted knights and men-at-arms) with their ability to rapidly fire volleys of arrows, Yeoman Archers are considered part of the Infantry Revolution of the 14th century. The Battles of Crécy and Agincourt are the best known victories of the Yeoman Archers."
 
 innovation_consulate_of_the_sea: "Carta Consular"
 innovation_consulate_of_the_sea_desc: "The Carta Consular, later Consolat de mar, 'Consulate of the Sea', was a quasi-judicial body that administered the international maritime and commercial laws in the western Mediterranean. \n\nThe institution, as well as related institutions such as the ius mercadorium, granted the merchants a series of liberties to resolve their own mercantile disputes without royal interference while giving the king financial compensation in return. \n\nWhile never applied to the whole Mediterranean, the Consulate of the Sea was still widespread throughout the entirety of the Crown of Aragon and present in major cities such as Valencia or Barcelona."
 
 innovation_luceran_archery: "Luceran Archery"
 innovation_luceran_archery_desc: "The Muslim settlement of Lucera was the result of the decision of the King of Sicily Frederick II of the Hohenstaufen dynasty (1194–1250) to move 20,000 Sicilian Muslims to Lucera, a settlement in Apulia in southern Italy. The community was responsible, among other obligations, for supplying the Kings of Sicily with a theoretical military contingent of around 14–15,000 men strong, of which 7–10,000, as reported by contemporary sources, were effectively employable on the battlefield at Cortenuova. These troops, most of them lightly armed archers and many also trained in the use of the sling, constituted the faithful personal bodyguard of the Hohenstaufens, since they had no connection to the political rivals of the "House of Swabia", were ready to wage war—ferociously even for the contemporary standards—on the local populations, and depended entirely on their sovereign."

 innovation_nubianization_desc: "During the 11th-century the kingdoms of Nubia went through a process of Nubianization, like the Kushites before them the Nubians adeptly absorbed and adapted foreign influences, synthesizing these influences with their own culture to create new unique forms of language, titular, and religion. One of the main initiators of this process of active Nubianization of courtly life has been suggested to have been Georgios, the archbishop of Dongola and hence the head of the Makurian church. He seems to have popularized the Nubian language as the written language to replace Nubian Greek, and counter the growing influence of Arabic in the Coptic Church of Egypt. Also introduced were more indigenous influences on the church such as the cult of dead rulers and bishops, as well as indigenous Nubian saints."
