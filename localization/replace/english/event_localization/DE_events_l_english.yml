By our might the Greeks have lost their influence over the Balkans, and our realm has replaced them. Now, even throughout Europe, we dare to compare ourselves to the ancient Roman Empire as the Eastern Roman Emperor and Patriarch of Constantinople can only kneel in awe of our might. My family and I have emerged as the unchallenged hegemony in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\nThe time is right for me to have myself recognized as Tsar of the Bulgarians and the true Basileus of the Romans with all its associated honor and authority.

  DE_decision_event.0012.desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Western Empire, the Italian peninsula has been fractured between rebellious city-states, greedy bishops, and barbarian conquerors.\n\nYet, under my dynasty's rule, Italy has set aside petty infighting and made itself whole once again, resurging as a dominant power in the West.

  DE_decision_event.0017.desc.lorgar: "For all that the fire of my belief burns as brightly as the Sun, I can't shake the feeling that there must be something #EMP more#! to the universe than just [old_faith.HighGodName]. Some more primordial truth."

  DE_decision_event.0020.desc: "Since time immemorial, Egypt has been considered a cradle of civilization.

And now it would seem [king_of_sicily.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to take advantage of this fact to introduce a new form of currency.\n\nCalled the Ducat and modeled on Byzantine trachea, it could be useful if we were to accept this currency as valid issue within our realm. Perhaps it could even serve as inspiration for a coin of our own..."

While perhaps not the majority in their communities, there are still many among those groups who call Sicily their home.\n\nHowever my accession to the Sicilian throne has not brought complete social and religious peace to Sicily. I've been told even now there are groups hoping to restore the dominion of Islam to the Island.\n\nMany of my advisors have pressured me to take some kind of action, but I have loathed to do so. But now, I feel I must act."
  DE_decision_event.0024.a: "They may remain in my realm, but not in Sicily itself"
  DE_decision_event.0024.b: "We are all God's creation, and as such, I shall accept them as they are"

  exile_sicilian_muslims_decision_tooltip: "You mandate that every Muslim must either convert or be exiled from Sicily. While this will allow for greater religious cohesion (and more importantly Royal control) on the island, the impact on its economy can not be known"
  massacre_sicilian_muslims_decision_tooltip: "As the good Book says, "The Lord is vengeful against his foes; he rages against his enemies" and the Muslims are indeed my enemy. Well even if they are not, it is better to simply massacre them all to be safe"

  DE_decision_event.0025.desc: "For centuries, our homeland has been an arena for political, military, religious, and cultural rivalries and expansionism for whatever powers saw fit to try and impose their will - but no longer.

Never again shall my people be ignored and discounted; left at the mercy of greater powers that use their lands as their personal battleground. Lead by me and my descendants, Transcaucasia shall earn its' place among the great Empires of history!"
