  #Concepts
  #While Paradox has unfortunately moved away from this especially with CK3 I do like having actual historical information in the game (hence my bookmark text for characters being from Wikipedia rather than gamey paragraphs that barely tell you who that person was and what they did to actually be remembered). The eras CK3 uses are unsurprisingly very Eurocentric.
  culture_era_tribal:0 "Late Antiquity"
  culture_era_tribal_desc:0 "Late Antiquity is a period of transition from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages (3rd century AD to the 8th century AD). Many [cultures|E] and states throughout the Old World are undergoing great, dynamic social and political changes. Rulers with [tribal_government|E] can only make use of Late Antiquity [innovations|E]."
  culture_era_early_medieval_desc:0 "The [early_medieval|E] sees the emergence of professional administrators and a number of important [innovations|E], allowing a [culture|E] to exit the Dark Ages."
  culture_era_high_medieval_desc:0 "The [high_medieval|E] is a time of great technological and administrative progress, seeing towns grow into cities and the rise of the burgher class even as the aristocracy reigns supreme."
  culture_era_late_medieval_desc:0 "The [late_medieval|E] marks the zenith of the feudal world. Bureaucrats, artisans, merchants and money lenders are starting to encroach on the power of the old privileged classes, except for the monarchs themselves."
  
  game_concept_anglosaxons:0 "Anglian and Saxon"
  game_concept_anglosaxons_desc:0 "In the late 9th and early 10th centuries, the kings of Wessex defeated the Danes and liberated the Angles from the Danelaw. They united their house in marriage with the surviving Angle royalty, and were accepted by the Angles as their kings. This marked the passing of the old Anglo-Saxon world and the dawn of the "English" as a new people."
  
  game_concept_rusnorse:0 "Norse and East Slavic Tribes"
  game_concept_rusnorse_desc:0 "The formation of the Rus' began with the arrival of Norse people, mainly originating from present-day Sweden, settling and ruling along the river-routes between the Baltic and the Black Seas from around the 8th to 11th centuries AD. They formed a state known in modern historiography as Kievan Rus', which was initially a multiethnic society where the ruling Norsemen merged and assimilated with East Slavic, Baltic and Finnic tribes, ending up with Old East Slavic as their common language."
  
  game_concept_early_medieval:0 "Early Medieval Era"
  game_concept_early_medieval_desc:0 "The Early Middle Ages or Early Medieval Period, sometimes referred to as the Dark Ages (a term modern historians no longer use), is typically regarded by historians as lasting from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century. The alternative term Late Antiquity, for the early part of the period, emphasizes elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while Early Middle Ages is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the earlier medieval period.\n\nIn 800 the title of Emperor was revived in Western Europe with Charlemagne, whose Carolingian Empire greatly affected later European social structure and history. Europe experienced a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the feudal system, which adopted such innovations as three-field planting and the heavy plough. Barbarian migration stabilized in much of Europe, although the Viking expansion greatly affected Northern Europe.\n\nAfter Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in medicine, algebra, geometry, astronomy, anatomy, and ethics that would later finds it way back to Western Europe."
  game_concept_high_medieval:0 "High Medieval Era"
  game_concept_high_medieval_desc:0 "The High Middle Ages, or High Medieval Period, was the period of European history that lasted from around AD 1000 to 1250. The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around AD 1500.\n\nKey historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the rapidly increasing population of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the Renaissance of the 12th century, including the first developments of rural exodus and of urbanization. By 1250, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 19th century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a series of calamities, most notably the Black Death, but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation.\n\nIn the Middle East this was the peak of the Islamic Golden Age which traditionally ended with the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate due to the Mongol invasion and the Siege of Baghdad."
  game_concept_late_medieval:0 "Late Medieval Era"
  game_concept_late_medieval_desc:0 "The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history lasting from AD 1250 to 1500. The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern period (and in much of Europe, the Renaissance).\n\nAround 1300, centuries of prosperity and growth in Europe came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what it had been before the calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict, the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was temporarily shattered by the Western Schism. Collectively, those events are sometimes called the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.\n\nDespite the crises the 14th century was also a time of great progress in the arts and sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the Renaissance of the 12th century through contact with Arabs during the Crusades, but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the Capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy."
  game_concept_tributary_desc:0 "A tributary state is a term for a pre-modern state in a particular type of subordinate relationship to a more powerful state which involved the sending of a regular token of submission, or tribute, to the superior power. This token often took the form of a substantial transfer of wealth, such as the delivery of gold, produce or slaves, so that tribute might best be seen as the payment of protection money. Or it might be more symbolic: sometimes it amounted to no more than the delivery of a mark of submission such as the bunga mas (golden flower) that rulers in the Malay peninsula used to send to the kings of Siam, or the Tribute of the Maltese Falcon that the Grand Master of the Order of St. John used to send annually to the Viceroy of Sicily in order to rule Malta. It might also involve attendance by the subordinate ruler at the court of the hegemon in order to make a public show of submission."

  #Map Items - Initially to change some of the inconsistent Paradox naming ie Mare Incognitum for Impassable Water but using Impassable Terrain instead of Terra Incogita for land or remove modern names like Celtic Sea. The rest is since I tend to go overboard with these things and Paradox wasn't consistent with whether to use local or English names either ie using Cote D'Azur instead of Azure Coast.
