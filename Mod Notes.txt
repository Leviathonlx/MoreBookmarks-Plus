#Other mod integration#
Files tend to be organized with tags so that I can easily comment out sections or remove files when DLC's come out until the integrated mod gets updated



#MGR Integration - Credit towards Neutrino

	Vanilla files touched due to integration of some rules from MGR that I liked. Mainly focused on rules that are the least likely to massively break in a DLC and don't cause too many compatibility issues

					####Anything dealing with MGR has #MGR in the file for easy searching#####

##Events - These could technically be overwritten and the only thing that'd happen is a rule wouldn't work 100%

	feast_default_events
	hunt_events
	pilgrimage_events
	councillor_spouse_intrigue_events
	councillor_spouse_learning_events
	spymaster_task_events

##Res Republica Integration. Credit towards Caden335##

# To add families to a republic, set their employer(shortly before start date) and use the effect 'add_family_to_republic_families = yes' in the history for them.

#Republics#
- First year is first bookmark title exists. Last is either when it was conquered or turned into a feudal state

Amalfi - 769-870

Venice - Entire game

Ragusa - Entire game

Ancona - 1066-Rest of game

Pisa - 1066–Rest of game

Genoa - ~1066-Rest of game

Gotland - 1066-1081. Brief resurgence in 1100's

Channel Islands - 1081-Rest of game

The Hansa - 1227-Rest of game 


--


Interior Italian Republics
- Only republics that actually had varied families and not republics that were consistently ruled by only one family (such as Piacenza). End dates are last bookmark it existed before it was conquered or turned into a feudal state (such as Milan)
- Many of these republics shared families so having a type of elective government instead of a 'republic' would actually fit better as patrician family follows the family head

Republic of Arezzo - 1167-Rest of game

Republic of Florence - 1167-Rest of game

Republic of Lucca - 1160-Rest of game

Republic of Mantua - 1167-Rest of game

Republic of Parma - 1138-Rest of game

Novgorod - 1136–Rest of game #Not sure how to do this one given it didn't really have consistent patrician houses. An elective government probably would be best

Utland (Denmark) - 993-Rest of game #Doesn't exist in CK3 and I'd need to add baronies to Denmark for this

###Game Concepts###


Need defined in MB_game_concepts and localization with the alias being whatever text you're using



######################################################################################################################################################



####Bookmarks####


	When adding new bookmarks look at the error log for duplicate characters from vanilla files or other character errors like fathers being set as woman or people set as their own father. A bookmark WILL NOT LOAD if it has any assertion errors in the error log.
	The background for each date is a .dds file in \gfx\interface\bookmarks 
	Icons are set in \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_big and \gfx\interface\icons\bookmark_buttons 
	Character portraits are set with the command dump_bookmark_portraits once you load a bookmark. Those go in bookmark_portraits and when generated go to \Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\common\bookmark_portraits in your documents directory
	Positions are updated in real time and aren't too hard to setup



######################################################################################################################################################



####Cultures####


For mass fixing localization

https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/guide-automate-name-localization-with-a-text-editor.1435190/

- New Cultures -

I generally used M&T in EU4 for a broad idea of language spread though that is a culture map of 1356 which is the end of CK's timeframe. Main focus was to break up some of the larger cultures such as Occitan and French but there are exceptions to this. Rus' for example is fully correct for this time period as the cultural subdivisions of east Slavic cultures did not truly start to form till EU4's time period.

I generally made families that controlled a region for a long period of time whichever culture the area they own is. House Savoy, for example, was marked French in CK3 and HIP but likely originated from Magdeburg all the way in Saxony but my guess is they were marked French since they maybe spoke French (though in that case most of western Europe would be 'French') or maybe it was based on the House Savoy of EU4's time period. It made more sense to make the family Arpitan than French.


Cultures marked with whether they are from HIP or what parent culture I used as a basis. Names are exactly as they are in the culture file.

My edits are generally at the top of a file.



Culture group change:

Occitan and all its dialects are now in the Iberian group instead of Frankish
Assyrian in own cultural group

####Map and Titles####

Eventually will further detail the map but will not go overboard as while you can add 100 new provinces to France it will greatly imbalance the map (as seen in many other mods that do this with England and France fielding 15k troops and making tons of gold while the HRE has 5k) and make traveling across northern France take as long as traveling across all of Tibet. All counties should have at least 3 baronies unless they are a tiny island such as Malta or a tiny county. Not making new counties except in rare cases as the current county count is acceptable. Some islands can still be broken up into separate counties (such as the Adriatic Isles) but won't worry about that until CK3 actually implements Republics. Not worried about this till the DLC.


Most counties should have 3 baronies so they can have 1 of each holding type. Duchy capitals at 4 baronies unless it's a tiny duchy and Kingdom capitals should have 5 with very rare cases of 6.

Red - Baronies that need replaced or altered.

First parenthesis is the amount of baronies. Some areas like Iberia are heavily impacted by de_jure changes as Andalusia shrinks. These counts are after the 300 baronies I've already added.
