#Stuff to do eventually

-A decision for Byzantium to put Anatolia back into it's dejure

- Add missing parts of map in Asia


#Roads to Power

Overall

Check CE, Ibn Battuta, RICE when updated

is_landed should be checked if it should be changed to is_playable_character where it'd make sense

special_contract

Map:
	- Add to new geographical regions

	- Check Paradox province changes? Probably not worth it as my settup is likely still better
	
Common:

Look at further edits needed to 07_frankokratia_triggers in scripted_triggers. Currently just edited to not work after 1204

Look at Holy Site balance. Some of the added holy sites are overpowered compared to vanilla's

Go over court position requirements in MB_00_court_position_triggers

Had to port over vanilla game_start due to a building script causing an extreme amount of buildings in later bookmarks. Look at it later to reduce the effect since the idea behind the script is good


History:

Less a to do and more a reminder. Unlanded adventurers need titles set in landed_titles and history

Landless effects:

effect = {
			set_landless_government_effect = yes
		}
		
effect = { add_character_flag = do_not_generate_starting_family }


Admin effects:

#For some reason not auto set?

1066.9.15 = {
		domicile ?= { move_domicile = root.top_liege.capital_province }
	}

Graphics:

Per Celticus move over EPE's improved Chinese helmets as the ones in the mod cause performance issues


GUI/GFX

Look at the new dungeon section of ingame.txt to see if edits are needed for Asia. 


Events:

Check Community Patch when it's fully updated for the DLC. Mainly for the harm events and single combat file and the travel events and activities folders
Check roman_restoration_events if changes needed for my map
