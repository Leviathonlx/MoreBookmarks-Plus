				#Like the idea of this event from Shogunate since it fixes the fact that alliances aren't properly set on bookmark load when it comes to who a rulers children are married to though it was a bit too broad. Commented out the is_nibling_of since there really shouldn't be alliances based on who your niece or nephew married (maybe that was a thing in the Shogunate?). I can believe a alliance between Kingdoms at least persisting for someones aunt or uncle. Replaced is_close_family_of with is_grandparent_of since the other part of this script already covers parents, children, and siblings and so the game made duplicate alliances
