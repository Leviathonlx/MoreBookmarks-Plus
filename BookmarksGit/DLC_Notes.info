To do:




EPE blendshapes when updated / female/male head folders in portraits

Asia models when shogunate and oe update

Extend new siberia effect to parts of tibet as well?

Tributaries and confederations. Eventually see if confederations could be adapted for the Leagues. Tribs are set in 00_tributary_setup_effect. Currently commented out due to my map setup not matching the base game

Setup nomad government and holdings. Figure out what to do with herders as they're an arbitrary gameplay mechanic and it's not reasonable to do them randomly like the base game does when I have so many bookmarks

Double check special buildings from other mods (mainly BAP as it'll never be updated) to see which ones should be given raid_protection_1 etc.




Removed:

Mandala Government 				- It added too much extra work when updating, was prone to having issues, and wasn't that noticeably different from feudal. Easier to remove until Paradox adds their own Mandala Government later this year
New Terrains					- Involved a ton of edited files for very little noticeable effect on the game especially when terrain doesn't have much impact on the game in the first place		--		Do a touchup on terrains after though mainly for where savanna was
Silk Road						- Was literally nothing but modifiers. Something dealing with the Silk Road will be added to the DLC later this year
