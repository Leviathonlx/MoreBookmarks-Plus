Common Folder

Double check special buildings from other mods (mainly BAP as it'll never be updated) to see which ones should be given raid_protection_1 etc.



Removed:

Mandala Government 				- It added too much extra work when updating, was prone to having issues, and wasn't that noticeably different from feudal. Easier to remove until Paradox adds their own Mandala Government later this year
New Terrains					- Involved a ton of edited files for very little noticeable effect of the game especially when terrain doesn't have much impact on the game in the first place
