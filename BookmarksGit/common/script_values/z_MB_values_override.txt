#Edit of the landless value


# Laamps above this count must be exceptional characters or of interest to the player.
## This is because there are various things they do that are _fairly_ unperformant, so it's important that we put a good soft-cap on their numbers to stop them growing out of control and tanking performance.
### Code decisions were made assuming that there would be _maybe_ 200 on the map in the late game, give or take ~50.
#### More than that will work mechanically but prepare for substantial frame rate drops.
