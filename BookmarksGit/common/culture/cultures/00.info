#Consolidated culture files so there aren't, for example, 6 different files for 'byzantine' and since 31 culture files looks better than 120 and now I don't need to play 'hunt down all the turkic cultures in 8 files' if I need to edit things like ethnicities. They are mostly grouped up by language group.
