#Stuff to do eventually

-A decision for Byzantium to put Anatolia back into it's dejure

- Add missing parts of map in Asia


#Current WIP: Culture cleanup
#Clean up the files in cultures, name lists, and pillars and properly assign things like languages and deal with the many duplicates																		- Done
#Clean up the languages as a whole. These were inconsistently done between the various mods. Go through every single language and fully setup CCU and languages to be consistent across all cultures		- In progress
#Clean up traditions as a whole. These are incredibly inconsistent with some cultures (especially in China) having SEVEN traditions while most in Europe have 3. Cultures should have 4 at most				- To be done


#Roads to Power

Overall

Check CE, Ibn Battuta, RICE when updated


Common:

Go over court position requirements in MB_00_court_position_triggers

Had to port over vanilla game_start due to a building script causing an extreme amount of buildings in later bookmarks. Look at it later to reduce the effect since the idea behind the script is good - Can't be done without causing the same issues I had before in making everything max level holdings


GUI/GFX

Look at the new dungeon section of ingame.txt to see if edits are needed for Asia. 


Events:

Check Community Patch when it's fully updated for the DLC. Mainly for the harm events and single combat file and the travel events and activities folders
Check roman_restoration_events if changes needed for my map
