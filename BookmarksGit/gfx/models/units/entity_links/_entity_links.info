	# Use for armies of this quality level or above. Default: 0 (matches anything)

	# Optional. Can be used to lock a specific entity behind a DLC flag. If the DLC is not present, it will try to
	# select the next graphical_culture, otherwise defaults to the fallback option instead

	# The priority for which entity to use is defined by the graphical_cultures list in the cultures DB (common/culture/cultures):
