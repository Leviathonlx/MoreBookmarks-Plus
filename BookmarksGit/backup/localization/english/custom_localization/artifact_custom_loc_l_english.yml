 #Marco Polo quotes
 marco_polo_quote_intro_1: "You will hear it for yourself, and it will surely fill you with wonder."
 marco_polo_quote_intro_2: "The world is a vast tapestry, woven with the threads of different cultures and traditions."
 marco_polo_quote_desc_1: "We go naked because we want nothing of this world; for we came into the world naked and unclothed. As for not being ashamed to show our members, the fact is that we do no sin with them and therefore have no more shame in them than you have when you show your hand or face or the other parts of your body that do not lead you into carnal sin; whereas you use your members to commit sin and lechery, and so you cover them up and are ashamed of them. But we are no more ashamed of showing them than we are of showing our fingers, because we do not sin with them."
 marco_polo_quote_desc_2: "And I assure you that the womenfolk buy and sell and do all that is needful for their husbands and households. For the men do not bother themselves about anything but hunting and warfare and falconry. They live on meat and milk and game and on rats, which are abundant eveywhere."
 marco_polo_quote_desc_3: "They are stout fighters, excelling in courage and hardihood. Let me explain how it is that they can endure more than any other men. Often enough, if need be, they will go or stay for a whole month without provisions, drinking only the milk of a mare and eating wild game of their own taking."
 marco_polo_quote_desc_4: "Here is another strange custom which I had forgotten to describe, You may take it for a fact that, when there are two men of whom one has had a male child who has died at the age of four, or what you will, and the other has had a female child who has also died, they arrange a marriage between them."
 marco_polo_quote_desc_5: "There are certain great and deep valleys, to the bottom of which there is no access. Wherefore the men who go in search of the diamonds take with them pieces of flesh, as lean as they can get, and these they cast into the bottom of a valley. When the eagles see the meat thrown down they pounce upon it and carry it up to some rocky hill-top. The people go to the nests of those white eagles, of which there are many, and in their droppings they find plenty of diamonds which the birds have swallowed in devouring the meat that was cast into the valleys."
 marco_polo_quote_desc_6: "There is a fountain of oil which discharges so great a quantity as to furnish loading for many camels. The use made of it is not for the purpose of food, but as an unguent for the cure of cutaneous distempers in men and cattle, as well as other complaints, and it is also good for burning. In the surrounding country no other oil is used in their lamps, and people come from distant parts to procure it."
 marco_polo_quote_desc_7: "If it be questioned how the population of the country can supply sufficient numbers of these duties, and by what means they can be supported, we may answer, that all the idolaters, keep six, eight, or ten women, according to their circumstances, by whom they have a prodigious number of children. Some of them have as many as thirty sons capable of following their fathers in arms."
 marco_polo_quote_end_1: "I speak and speak, but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. It is not the voice that commands the story: it is the ear."
 marco_polo_quote_end_2: "For, tell it how I might, you never would be satisfied that I was keeping within truth and reason."
