 az_tour.0001.t: "A Scholar's Recitation"
 az_tour.0001.desc: "[stop_host_scope.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] raises a hand for silence as servants clear the last dishes. From beside [stop_host_scope.GetHerHim], [scholar.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] steps forward and, with measured voice, begins to recite a verse — elegant lines on the passage of time and the weight of virtue.\n\nWhen the applause settles, [stop_host_scope.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] turns to me with a smile. "And what words might your heart offer, [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]?""
 az_tour.0001.a.diplomacy: "Speak on how harmony sustains the realm."
 az_tour.0001.a.martial: "Argue that virtue must be defended with strength."
 az_tour.0001.a.stewardship: "Reflect on the burden of righteous governance."
 az_tour.0001.a.intrigue: "Suggest the [stop_host_scope.GetTitleAsName] acknowledged quiet power."

 az_tour.0002.t: "The Cost of Refinement"
 az_tour.0002.desc: "[stop_host_scope.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] steps forward with a smile and presents a lacquered box, bound in a ribbon of fine [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalFabric')].\n\n"It would shame me to let [ROOT.Char.Custom('FormOfAddressForLiege')] depart without a token of my esteem," [stop_host_scope.GetSheHe] says. "Inside are some modest treasures — polished lacquerware, an ancient verse penned in flowing hand, and incense once favored in the halls of high office."\n\nThe gesture is graceful. Yet the gleam of the silver trays, the rare grain of the [ROOT.Province.Custom('GetRandomRegionalWood')] panels — they speak of means beyond what this station should afford. I glance again at the gift. It is... extravagant."
 az_tour.0002.a: ""A most elegant gift. I am honored.""
 az_tour.0002.b: ""Your taste is exquisite... almost suspiciously so.""
 az_tour.0002.c: ""I cannot, in good conscience, accept this.""

 az_tour.0003.t: "A Whisper in the Cup"
 az_tour.0003.desc: "As the [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalDrink')] flows and conversation drifts around me, [servant.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] steps forward to refill my cup. But instead of merely pouring, [servant.GetHerHis] fingers press a folded slip of paper into my hand — and vanish as swiftly as [servant.GetSheHe] came.\n\nBeneath the table, I open it. A name. A deed. A scandal. It of my host: [stop_host_scope.GetTitledHouseNameOrFirstName]. The note is brief, but the implication unmistakable.\n\nAnd across the table, [stop_host_scope.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] smiles, oblivious."
 az_tour.0003.a: "I will keep this close... for now."
 az_tour.0003.b: "This should not go unspoken."

 az_tour.0003.d: "I will take this straight to the top!"

 az_tour.1003.t: "A Whisper in the Cup"
 az_tour.1003.desc: "[visiting_liege.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] gestures lightly for me to join [visiting_liege.GetHerHim] near the side chamber, just as the servers begin to change the course.\n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetFirstName]," [visiting_liege.GetSheHe] begins, voice silk-wrapped steel. "A letter reached my hand — the ink still fresh. It tells of certain... indiscretions. One would dismiss such talk, were it not whispered by more than one mouth."\n\nOutside, the clatter of dishes and quiet laughter continues, the partition screen casting flickering shadows across the polished floor."
az_tour.1003.a: ""Lies and slander. I will not hear another word!""
az_tour.1003.b: ""You have my silence... and what follows with it.""
az_tour.1003.c: "A fortune to still your tongue."

 az_tour.0004.t: "A Matter of Governance"
 az_tour.0004.desc.intro: "Between bites and polite sips of [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalDrink')], a conversation at the table turns heated. [stop_host_scope.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] raises a pressing matter of governance — not directly to me, but clearly within earshot.\n\n"
 az_tour.0004.desc.stewardship: ""We cannot afford another coin lost to folly," [stop_host_scope.GetTitledHouseNameOrFirstName] insists. "Development funds must go where they yield the greatest return."\n\n"And yet roads crack and ditches run dry while the treasury sits idle," [opposing_counsel.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] counters."
 az_tour.0004.desc.martial: ""My garrison lacks horses, and you speak of parade armor?" [opposing_counsel.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] says flatly.\n\n"Discipline begins with pride in one's station," [stop_host_scope.GetTitledHouseNameOrFirstName] retorts, brows raised."
 az_tour.0004.desc.learning: ""This new method of land surveying has the backing of reputable texts," [stop_host_scope.GetTitledHouseNameOrFirstName] argues, tone firm.\n\n"And yet no scholar here has vouched for its soundness," [opposing_counsel.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] replies, cool and cutting."
 az_tour.0004.a: "I must agree with our host's assessment."
 az_tour.0004.b.stewardship: "A balanced budget serves all — I offer this compromise."
 az_tour.0004.b.stewardship.tt: "Divert a portion of the surplus to urgent repairs, and the rest to long-term investments. Frugality need not mean neglect."
 az_tour.0004.b.martial: "Security must be practical, not ornamental. Let me weigh in."
 az_tour.0004.b.martial.tt: "Equip the garrison for function, not display — armor fit for the field, and horses enough for patrols. Glory follows discipline, not gilding."
 az_tour.0004.b.learning: "Let reason prevail. I suggest a rational resolution."
 az_tour.0004.b.learning.tt: "Trial the new method in a single district under careful observation. If it proves sound, expand. If not, discard it — as any good theory must allow."
 az_tour.0004.c: "This is a dinner, not a debate hall."

 az_tour.0005.t: "A Broken Note"
 az_tour.0005.desc: "A hush falls over the hall as a musician plays a note too hard — a sharp twang cuts through the murmurs like a slap. The melody dies.\n\n[stop_host_scope.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] stiffens in place.\n\n"Ah — my apologies," the musician stammers, bowing low with [musician.GetHerHis] instrument trembling in hand. A few guests pause mid-sip of their [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalDrink')], glancing about uncertainly.\n\n[stop_host_scope.GetTitledHouseNameOrFirstName] forces a smile, but the flush on [stop_host_scope.GetHerHis] cheeks is unmistakable. "A small mishap," [stop_host_scope.GetSheHe] says lightly, voice tight. "Let us not lose the joy of the evening over this.""
 az_tour.0005.a: ""A fine performance, despite the accident!""
 az_tour.0005.b: ""We've hardly begun; fetch my [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetMusicalInstrument')]!""
 az_tour.0005.c: ""I was barely paying attention to begin with."" 

 az_tour.1005.t: "A Higher Melody"
 az_tour.1005.desc: "A sharp crack — then silence. The [ROOT.GetCharacter.Custom('GetMusicalInstrument')] snaps mid-note, and the stunned hush that follows is more piercing than the music ever was. A second performer fumbles their entry. A third coughs nervously. The performance collapses, one missed note at a time.\n\nBefore I can rise or summon a replacement, [visiting_liege.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] steps forward and lifts a [visiting_liege.Custom('GetMusicalInstrument')] from its case. No fanfare, no announcement — just the quiet confidence of someone used to being heard.\n\nThe first notes drift out like incense, slow and searching. Conversation fades. Goblets lower. Even the servants pause. The [visiting_liege.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], once my guest, now commands the hall as a performer.\n\nAnd when the last chord shivers into silence, all I can do is sit with the weight of it."
 az_tour.1005.a: "A performance of unmatched brilliance — truly magnificent!"
 az_tour.1005.b: "Such mastery! I feel moved to better myself."
 az_tour.1005.c: ""This performance is beneath [visiting_liege.GetHerHis] status.""

 az_tour.0006.t: "An Impertinent Interruption"
 az_tour.0006.desc: "A shout breaks through the laughter and music of the festival. A [angry_farmer.GetWomanMan] in worn clothes pushes forward, face flushed with indignation. [angry_farmer.GetSheHe|U] plants [angry_farmer.GetHerHis] feet and raises [angry_farmer.GetHerHis] voice above the crowd.\n\n"We work hard in the fields, but all the money goes to silks and feasts! You sit under lanterns, drinking [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalDrink')] — but who's looking out for those of us with empty bowls?"\n\nThe festival stills. [visiting_liege.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)|U] gives me a glance — cautious, and clearly displeased."
 az_tour.0006.a: ""This will be looked into. You have my word.""
 az_tour.0006.b: ""Festivals are not for complaints.""

 az_tour.1006.t: "An Impertinent Interruption"
 az_tour.1006.desc.intro: "The market square hums with music and the clamor of celebration, but not all voices are raised in joy. A local farmer, red-faced and animated, pushes through the crowd, glaring at [stop_host_scope.GetTitledHouseNameOrFirstName]."
 az_tour.1006.desc.a: ""We work hard in the fields, but all the money goes to silks and feasts! You sit under lanterns, drinking [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalDrink')] — but who's looking out for those of us with empty bowls?"\n\nThe host's face tightens, but [stop_host_scope.GetSheHe] answers calmly, promising compensation and assigning a steward to see to the damage."

You sit under lanterns, drinking [stop_host_scope.Custom('RegionalDrink')] — but who's looking out for those of us with empty bowls?"\n\n[stop_host_scope.GetSheHe|U] gives a slow, indulgent smile. "Your bowls are not my concern. Guards, seize this [angry_farmer.Custom2('InsultNoun', ROOT.Char)]!" Gasps ripple through the crowd as the farmer is arrested by [stop_host_scope.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] guards and dragged away, [angry_farmer.GetHerHis] curses disappearing under the sound of music."

"We are gathered in peace. Let tempers cool and cups be filled — I am sure we can hear your grievance without disruption." The farmer shifts uncomfortably, the indignation still in [angry_farmer.GetHerHis] eyes, but [angry_farmer.GetHerHis] tone softens under the weight of formality."

 az_tour.0007.t: "Flattery in Bloom"
 az_tour.0007.desc: "Beneath a lantern-lit canopy of blossoming branches, an attendant announces [elegant_noble.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)]. They step forward, cradling a scroll of delicate brushwork. Painted mountains rise from the silk, their peaks crowned with flowering trees, while flowing script winds beside them — a union of harmony and strength.\n\n"The hills may crumble," [elegant_noble.GetSheHe] says with a modest smile, "but spring always returns — even if only for a breath. This," [elegant_noble.GetSheHe] continues, holding my gaze, "is a reflection of your rule, [ROOT.Char.Custom('FormOfAddressForLiege')]."\n\nThe artistry is undeniable, the sentiment disarmingly flattering.

"How graceful," [visiting_liege.GetSheHe] says, voice smooth as lacquer. "There is a certain charm in such provincial honesty." Before I can breathe, the whisper begins — a rustle along the benches, fans tilted to mask smirks.

Brush in hand, [revered_scholar.GetSheHe] begins a deliberate transcription from the classics, each character drawn with patient care until the parchment seems to breathe with meaning.\n\nIt would be telling, wouldn't it, if [visiting_liege.Custom2('MyCharacterIntroduction', ROOT.Char)] were the one to judge this work?
