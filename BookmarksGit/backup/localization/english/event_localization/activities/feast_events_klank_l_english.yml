 feast_events_klank.1001.t: "Ways of Torture"
 feast_events_klank.1001.desc: ""Where is the best place to start cutting?" asks my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', SCOPE.sC('fellow_torturer'))] [fellow_torturer.GetName], with a dagger in [fellow_torturer.GetHerHis] hand, [fellow_torturer.GetHerHis] tone full of wonder. Truly a [fellow_torturer.GetWomanMan] after my own heart. A feast can be a meeting of minds, an opportunity to perfect a craft, not only a dull opportunity for gluttony. \n\n"In my experience, they scream the loudest if you remove the [ROOT.Char.Custom('GetRandomBodyPart')] first. I am convinced of it... this is the most delicious way to begin."\n\n[terrified_onlooker.GetName] stares silently in the corner."
 feast_events_klank.1001.a: "First, wiggle [ROOT.Char.Custom('DeviantObjectArticle')] in front of them."
 feast_events_klank.1001.b: "You are quite right!"
 feast_events_klank.1001.c: "A book like #EMP [SCOPE.Custom('RandomEntertainmentTextName')]#! inspires."
