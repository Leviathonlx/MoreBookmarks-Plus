Those that survive must watch helplessly as all around them perish.\n\nThe devoted look to the divine for a savior, and the powerful their riches, but none can truly be safe. Dreadful tendrils spread across the land, constricting it until it no longer breathes.\n\nThe Black Death is upon us. [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] save us all."

The living are left to sweep ash from thresholds and count the empty mats.\n\nSome chant sutras, others cling to ritual and rank — but no decree halts decay, no merit offsets the toll. Like mist in a valley, the plague spreads unseen, yet felt in every still morning.\n\nThe Black Death is here. Heaven avert its gaze."
