 tgp_japan_career.0001.t: "The Tale of the [new_ruler.GetDynastyNameNoTooltip]"
 tgp_japan_career.0001.desc: "[kampaku.GetPrimaryTitle.GetDefinitiveName|U] is teeming with [blocs|E] all vying for control and power."
 tgp_japan_career.0001.soryo_desc: "As a [new_ruler.GetGovernment.GetName] ruler, my family has tamed the provinces and put down rebellions! We deserve a degree of autonomy and personal might not afforded to those effete [ritsuryo|E] who push papers in the capital, [kampaku.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier|U].\n\nI must grow my army, defend my fief and expand our dominion. It falls to me to restore order to [kampaku.GetPrimaryTitle.GetNameNoTier], and glory to my [house|E] — the [new_ruler.GetHouse.GetName]!"
 tgp_japan_career.0001.ritsuryo_desc: "As a [new_ruler.GetGovernment.GetName] ruler, my duties as a bureaucrat lie in the capital, [kampaku.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier|U]. This center of power and culture is fertile ground for growing the influence of my house, be it via exemplary deeds or canny statecraft.\n\nThese elegant traditions are being undermined by upstart, provincial [soryo|E] warriors seeking to consolidate power and grow their personal fiefs."
 tgp_japan_career.0001.kampaku_desc: "As the [new_ruler.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|U], I bear ultimate responsibility for the empire in my role as [ceremonial_regent|E]. From the capital, [kampaku.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier|U], I lead the [japanese_emperor_possessive|E] subjects and endeavor to maintain the fragile peace.\n\nI must juggle the power politics of a febrile court full of devious [ritsuryo|E] bureaucrats as well as the growing concern of [soryo|E] warriors setting up personal fiefs in the provinces."
 tgp_japan_career.0001.tenno_desc: "As the [japanese_emperor|E], my duties lie with the divine and ceremonial. The [kampaku.GetTitleAsName|U] handles all worldly things, but should he? There is tension in the realm as [soryo|E] [rulers|E] set up personal fiefs in the provinces, challenging the traditional [ritsuryo|E] bureaucrats in my capital, [kampaku.GetCapitalLocation.GetTitle.GetNameNoTier|U].\n\nCould these agents of change help us return to an age of true imperial rule with the [new_ruler.GetTitleAsName|U] overseeing matters celestial and earthly?"
 tgp_japan_career.0001.desc_2: "\n\nWe all have a role to play, and play it we shall!"
 tgp_japan_career.0001.a: "No matter what comes, we shall stand firm."
 tgp_japan_career.0001.b: "Peace is fleeting, we must be ready!"
