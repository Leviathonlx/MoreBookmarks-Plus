 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0054.desc.intro: "$tgp_dynastic_cycle.0052.desc.intro_common$\n\nOur goal is to share the beauty of art and knowledge. Cultivation of the mind and the soul is a sure way to be graced by the Heavens."

 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0054.desc.expansion: "The [ROOT.Char.GetTopLiege.GetDynastyName] is on a destructive path. Armies are expensive, and generals are fickle and dangerous. We have to steer the power away from them."

 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0056.desc.expansion: "However, the [ROOT.Char.GetTopLiege.GetName] is busy wasting lives of our brothers and sisters in mindless wars. While the generals run unchecked, grabbing power and offices away from our families."
 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0056.desc.conquest: "The [ROOT.Char.GetTopLiege.GetName] has to see that this is the only way to keep order in the realm. Everyone under Heavens will recognize the rule of the [ROOT.Char.GetTopLiege.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], if backed by our beloved families."
 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0056.desc.instability: "The [ROOT.Char.GetTopLiege.GetName] has lost a lot of credibility. The only way to restore [ROOT.Char.GetTopLiege.GetHerHis] grace is to ensure that [ROOT.Char.GetTopLiege.GetSheHe] follows our families."

 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0061.desc: "It is said that Heaven is impartial and always sides with the virtuous. It is equally said that the winner becomes a king, and the loser a bandit.

 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0062.desc.interloper: "As one [GetTitleByKey('h_china').GetHolder.Custom('WomanManPossessive')] allotted fortune diminishes, another's amplifies, for even kings and emperors are not immune to the vagaries of fate.\n\n[GetTitleByKey('h_china').GetHolder.GetTitledFirstName] has claimed the Mandate of Heaven, and all are expected to prostrate themselves at the feet of this new sovereign."
 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0062.desc.uninvolved: "Empires rise and fall, and the old yields to the new.

 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0091.desc: "Despite my assiduous efforts to rule righteously, more and more I hear whispers of discontent.\n\nI must face the uncomfortable prospect that faith in Heaven's favor for my reign may have begun to waver, for such sentiments can shake even the soundest foundations of a throne."

 # Notification for relevant people

 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0092.desc.involved: "The world suffers from a disease. A malady of the spirit.\n\nMalevolence and misconduct spread unchecked where pillars of virtue once stood strong. Immoral officials enrich themselves at the expense of the masses they govern, and soldiers ponder whether it is better to plunder than to protect."
 tgp_dynastic_cycle.0092.desc.interloper: "It seems not all is well in [GetTitleByKey('h_china').GetNameNoTierNoTooltip].\n\nWith every passing day, another caravan or convoy flees their lands in search of proverbial greener pastures.
