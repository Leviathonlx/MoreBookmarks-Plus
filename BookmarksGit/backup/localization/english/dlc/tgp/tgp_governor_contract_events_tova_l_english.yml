 governor_contract_events_tova.0050.desc: "An unusual amount of people line up in the streets of [deity_destination.GetName] to bow and burn incense before the shrine of an illicit deity. Farmers and city-dwellers alike are drawn from all corners of the realm to make whatever meager offerings they may. \n\nIf I do not handle the situation, these wild superstitions will continue to run rampant across the district."

 governor_contract_events_tova.0051.desc: "I follow the prominent smell of incense in [deity_destination.GetName], clear a path through the busy streets, and reach the offending shrine. \n\n[ROOT.Char.Custom('RandomPeasantGrievance')] Judging by the dirt splashed onto [worshipper.GetHerHis] pant legs, [worshipper.GetSheHe] traveled some distance to get here. \n\nWhen asked about the deity, [worshipper.GetSheHe] tells me it appears as [ROOT.Char.Custom('RandomVerySmallCreature')], and lives inside [ROOT.Char.Custom('RandomVerySmallCreatureDwelling')] by the side of the road."

Each of us makes our own fortune, through humanness and good moral conduct." \n\nThe crowd hushes, awestruck by my superior rhetoric skills. I clearly see the moment when everyone realizes the error of their ways, and begin to disperse."
 governor_contract_events_tova.0052.a: "As it should be."
 governor_contract_events_tova.0053.desc_burn: "My guards attempt to break through the crowd, and I am surprised to see the agitated worshippers pushing back! The torch that was meant for the shrine falls to the ground, and chaos ensues. \n\nMe and my entourage barely get out in time before the flames catch us."
 governor_contract_events_tova.0053.desc_debunk: ""...Which means the only real way we can ensure our own fortune is by doing good ourselves. But of course we should not act too much only to serve our self-interest. Now, what was I saying?" \n\nA murmur of disapproval sweeps through the crowd.
