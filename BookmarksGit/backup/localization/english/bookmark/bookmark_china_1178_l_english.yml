 bm_1178_china_desc: "China lies asunder. The Son of Heaven has been driven from the Central Plains by Jurchen invaders and the leading lights of the empire have chosen to pursue a policy of abject appeasement over the reclamation of the land of their ancestors.\n\nTigers and wolves roam rampant and rivers run red with the blood of the righteous. To have allowed such a calamitous fate to befall the empire, Heaven's disfavor must be profound.\n\n#bold The people cry out for a hero to bring an end to the disorder – who will answer the call?#!"

Who better to complete the conquest than the greatest Jurchan general?#!"
