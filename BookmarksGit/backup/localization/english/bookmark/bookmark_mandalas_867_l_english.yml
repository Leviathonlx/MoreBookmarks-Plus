 bm_867_mandalas: "Living Gods on Earth"
 bm_867_mandalas_desc: "There is no place where regal and spiritual power is as closely entwined as in Southeast Asia. For hundreds of years the Dharmic faiths have gained a stronger hold over its people, but only in the last century have those who were once Kings begun to assume the tile of Devaraja, God Kings.\n\n#bold Which of these God Kings will build a legacy of devotion, and who will be vanquished and forgotten?#!"

 bookmark_mandalas_867_jayavarman_angkor_desc: "Angkor has been a new and rising power since the time of Jayavarman II, the first of this line to assume the title of Devaraja. After his death, the realm is hardly recognizable as the great empire it once was, reduced to little more than a city state.\n\nYet to be the god of the Khmer is not an easy role to master. Jayavarman III has had trouble surpassing his predecessor and becoming a great architect himself.\n\n#bold Will the Varmans be able to live up to their divine legacy? Or will they be surpassed by others who claim the lordship over this earth?#!"

 bookmark_mandalas_867_indra_desc: "The small realm of Kutai was one of the first in the archipelago to invite Hindu priests to support their rule.\n\nHowever, the Segara dynasty have not been able to leverage this alliance into the kind of authority seen elsewhere, ruling over a realm that is as much built on tribal loyalties as it is religious ceremony.\n\n#bold Will Indra continue the path towards becoming a Mandala, or will he turn to his roots, embracing the ways of the island's tribal states?#!"

 bookmark_mandalas_867_padumaraja_desc: "Not yet as promising as the rising metropolises of Pagan or Angkor, the small Mon city state of Haripunjaya has often played the part of a subservient vassal, despite its privilege position between these realms.\n\nPadumaraja is the last of the Haripunjaya, a dynasty with grand ambitions that has, so far, failed to achieve a higher position.\n\n#bold Will Padumaraja finally be the one to elevate his dynasty towards the gods?#!"

 bookmark_mandalas_867_lokapala_desc: "Lokapala has taken control of the entire eastern part of Java and now enjoys a great deal of direct control. Yet the western part of the island still pays tribute to the rival Srivijayan emperors.\n\n#bold Is the destiny of the Sanjayas to extend their rule over the other islands? Or will they end up a peripheral tributary of the Srivijayan naval empire?#!"

 bookmark_mandalas_867_pyinbya_desc: "One of several competing cities in the Irrawady valley, Pagan is now a regional power, commanding a vast number of tributaries.\n\nPyinbya of Pagan comes from a long line of local kings, but he is the one who has turned a city into an aspiring realm.\n\n#bold Will Pyinbya turn Pagan into the grandiose capital it is destined to be?#!"
