 bm_1066_china: "Song of Splendor"
 bm_1066_china_desc: "Out of the ruins of the Tang was born the glory of the Song. Greatness such as this has not been seen for nearly two centuries – tribute flows to the imperial capital from afar like a mighty river, rebellions are infrequent and swiftly suppressed, and the government is firmly in the hands of the capable and meritorious.\n\nHowever, with great prosperity comes great temptation. Nomads have coveted the bounty of Central Plains since time immemorial, while even within the empire the unscrupulous oft cloak themselves with feigned nobility to divert its wealth into their own pockets.\n\n#bold The Son of Heaven holds the world in his palm, but what of those who may compel even the Son of Heaven to act according to their will?#!"

What fate will your hand guide him towards?#!"

 bookmark_china_1066_duan_silian_desc: "As a distant descendant of the founder of Dali, few would have imagined when he was born that Duan Sīlián would one day sit upon the throne, but fate is capricious and unpredictable.\n\nThe natural order of things was overturned by the powerful Gao family, second only to the imperial clan in influence, who deposed the dissolute then-reigning emperor and installed Sīlián in his place.\n\n#bold Will Sīlián Wáng escape the clutches of the Gao family to reign in his own right, or will he fall prey to their ambitions?#!"

Proven in battle, benevolent in governance, and diligent in justice, to his people his word is absolute.\n\nEven the sole shadow looming over his glorious reign, the absence of an heir, has recently been dispelled with the birth of his first son, Can Duc.\n\n#bold Can Nhat Ton Vuong raise Viet to an empire to rival its northern neighbor, or will lasting achievements prove ephemeral?#!"
