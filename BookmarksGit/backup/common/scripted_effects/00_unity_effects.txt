# UNITY EFFECTS

# This is a general effect to make you able to impact House Unity.
# The following scopes are needed:
#	CHARACTER	- The character doing the "action" that changes unity (usually scope:actor or ROOT)
#	TARGET		- The character being targeted by the "action"
#	VALUE		- How much unity should change (there are scripted values for these)
#	DESC		- A description of what CHARACTER did
