 arianism_desc: "Arianism is a Christological doctrine first attributed to Arius (c. AD 256–336), a Christian presbyter in Alexandria, Egypt. Arian theology holds that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, who was begotten by God the Father, and is distinct from the Father (therefore subordinate to him). However, in contrast with traditional Trinitarianism, Arianism holds that the Son is also the Son of God, but not co-eternal with God the Father in contrast. Much of south-eastern Europe and central Europe, including many of the Goths and Vandals respectively, had embraced Arianism (the Visigoths converted to Arian Christianity in 376 through their bishop Wulfila), which led to Arianism being a religious factor in various wars in the Roman Empire.\n\nIn the west, organized Arianism survived in North Africa, in Hispania, and parts of Italy until it was finally suppressed in the 6th and 7th centuries. Visigothic Spain converted to Nicene Christianity through their king Reccared I at the Third Council of Toledo in 589. Grimoald, King of the Lombards (662–671), and his young son and successor Garibald (671), were the last Arian kings in Europe."

 jacobite_adherent: "Syriac"
 jacobite_adherent_plural: "Syriacs"
 jacobite: "West Syriac Rite"
 jacobite_adj: "West Syriac"
 jacobite_desc: "Syriac Orthodox Christians, also known as Jacobites after their founder Jacob Baradeus are Miaphysite Christians, stressing that Christ had but a single nature, but of both human and divine character. The church gained its hierarchical distinctiveness in 512, when pro-Chalcedonian patriarch Flavian II of Antioch was deposed by Byzantine emperor Anastasius I Dicorus, and a synod was held at Laodicea in Syria in order to choose his successor, a prominent Miaphysite theologian Severus the Great. His later deposition was not recognized by the Miaphisite party, and thus a distinctive (autocephalous) Miaphysite patriarchate was established, headed by Severus and his successors. The nominal head of the Syriac Orthodox Church is the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch."

 nestorian_adj: "East Syriac"

 nestorian_adherent_plural: "Syriacs"
 nestorian_desc: "The Church of the East, also called various other names such as East Syriac Christianity or Nestorian, is a Christian branch which states that Christ has two separate natures - one divine and one human. This theological position was originally put forward from the Theological school of Edessa and had a powerful champion in the Patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius, but was condemned as heresy in 431. The Church of the East never accepted this condemnation though and Westerners have since then for varying reasons applied the term Nestorian to the Church of the East. The nominal head of the Church of the East is the Patriarch of the East. Despite this, its unique outlook has garnered followers in places as far east as China, India, and even Mongolia."

Key elements include specific chants, prayers, and variations in the order of the Mass. The Ambrosian Rite has deep historical roots and reflects the rich ecclesiastical heritage of Milan. Despite the Roman Rite's predominance, the Ambrosian Rite remains in use in the Archdiocese of Milan, contributing to the diversity of liturgical practices within the Catholic Church. The Archbishop of Milan exerts great influence over the Ambrosians."

 bulgarian_orthodox_desc: "Rooted in the 9th century, Medieval Bulgarian Orthodoxy defined the spiritual landscape of Bulgaria during the Middle Ages.

 georgian_orthodox_desc: "The Georgian Orthodox Church is located on the frontiers of Orthodoxy, in the Kingdom of Georgia. The Orthodox Church of Georgia is one of the oldest churches in the world. It asserts apostolic foundation, and that its historical roots can be traced to the early and late Christianization of Iberia and Colchis by Andrew the Apostle in the 1st century AD and by Saint Nino in the 4th century AD, respectively. While debates over when the Church wrestled free of neighboring authorities, it is undeniable that the Georgian people pride themselves on sovereignty from Antioch and Constantinople."

 abelian_adherent_plural: "Abelians"
 abelian_desc: "Emerging from the rustic countryside of Hippo Regius, the Abelians live in the same kind of continence that they believe Abel did. They do not believe in procreation, and encourage couples to practice abstinence and adopt children. Their beliefs blend together Christian, Jewish, Gnostic, and pagan ideas."
 bardaisanism: "Bardaisanism"
 bardaisanism_adj: "Bardaisanite"
 bardaisanism_adherent: "Bardaisanite"
 bardaisanism_adherent_plural: "Bardaisanites"
 bardaisanism_desc: "Bardaisanes, a 2nd century Syriac thinker and writer, deftly combined Christian theology with Gnosticism. He taught that while Almighty God endowed man with free will, the sun, moon, and planets are living beings that influence people's propensity to do good or evil. In contrast to other Gnostic sects, Bardaisanes also saw procreation in marriage as a positive force to understanding the divine."
 carpocratian: "Carpocratianism"
 carpocratian_adj: "Carpocratian"
 carpocratian_adherent: "Carpocratian"
 carpocratian_adherent_plural: "Carpocratians"
 carpocratian_desc: "According to Carpocrates and those who expanded on his teachings, like Marcellina, Jesus was not divine, but had a soul so pure and steadfast, he was able to free himself from the material realm, and no longer be bound by Mosaic Law or any other false morality. The Greek philosophers like Pythagoras, Plato, and Aristotle, are to be honored as a model like Jesus. Ultimately, all people are inherently equal, and property to be shared."
 collyridian: "Collyridianism"
 collyridian_adj: "Collyridian"
 collyridian_adherent: "Collyridian"
 collyridian_adherent_plural: "Collyridians"
 collyridian_desc: "The Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus, is the greatest of saints and she inspires us all with her purity, virtue, and holiness, as evidenced by the many miracles, intercessions, and apparitions attributed to her. Detractors claim we worship her as a pagan goddess. However, by venerating her and giving her offerings, we can worship God and come ever closer to Him."
 encratite: "Encratitism"
 encratite_adj: "Encratite"
 encratite_adherent: "Encratite"
 encratite_adherent_plural: "Encratites"
 encratite_desc: "The way to salvation is to refrain from wine, animal food, marriage, and intercourse, for these are the work of Satan – even the Eucharist cannot use wine. Those who refuse otherwise are, in effect, in league with the devil."
 jovinian: "Jovinianism"
 jovinian_adj: "Jovinian"
 jovinian_adherent: "Jovinian"
 jovinian_adherent_plural: "Jovinians"
 jovinian_desc: "Though restraint is admirable, extreme asceticism are heretical practices of the arrogant. The faithful should focus less on distinctions between sinful and more sinful, virtuous and more virtuous, celibate and married, ascetic and non-ascetic, and instead focus on keeping a pure heart as they do good works for the glory of God."
 novatianism_adj: "Novatian"
 novatianism_adherent: "Novatian"
 novatianism_adherent_plural: "Novatians"
 novatianism_desc: "The theologian Novatian taught that baptized Christians who deny their faith or perform pagan rituals, even to protect themselves from pagan prosecution, cannot be readmitted into the Church. Some may decry us as extremists, but how can these apostates be trusted? Allowing sinners back into the fold endangers the Church."
 rogatism_desc: "A splinter of the Donatists, the Rogatist sect founded by Rogatus is more conciliatory than the stern Donatists. Though they agree with the Donatists that clergy must be faultless, they abhor the use of violence in religious matters. As they often say, "No one should be compelled to follow righteousness.""
 orthodox: "Greek Orthodoxy" #Don't want the anachronistic 'Byzantine'. Even Eastern Orthodox wasn't used till more recently. Going with what it actually was called in this timeframe also keeps it consistent with other Orthodox churches such as the Bulgarian and Georgian churches. I'm sure I'll get some complaints still.
 orthodox_adj: "Greek Orthodox"
 orthodox_desc: "The Orthodox Church is the other main branch of Chalcedonian Christianity that up until 1054 was formally united with the Catholic Church, although the political division can be traced back to the crowning of Charlemagne as Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in 800, which did not sit well with the Emperor in Constantinople. The nominal head of the Orthodox Church is the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, but he does not interfere in the affairs of other Patriarchs."
 mozarabic_church: "Mozarabic Rite" #Mainly to keep it consistent with similar things like the Aquilean Rite
 mozarabic_church_adj: "Mozarabic"
 mozarabic_church_desc: "The Mozarabic Rite, in the past also called the Visigothic Rite, is a liturgical rite of the Latin Church once used generally in the Iberian Peninsula. A descendant of the early Iberian rites, Mozarabic Christianity has maintained a level of independence from Rome due to centuries under Islamic rule. Their long cohabitation with other faiths has made them more accepting of differences than more fundamentalist sects. The Kingdoms to the north began to follow Roman liturgy. One factor for the spread of the Roman liturgy into Iberia was the alliances the Christian kings made with Frankish rulers and monks. Another factor was the suspicion that the Hispanic liturgy might be unorthodox or heretical.\n\nWhile the liturgy is often called 'Mozarabic' after the Christian communities that lived under Muslim rulers in Al-Andalus that preserved its use, the rite itself developed before and during the Visigothic period. After experiencing a period of decline during the Reconquista, when it was superseded by the Roman Rite in the Christian states of Iberia as part of a wider programme of liturgical standardization within the Catholic Church, efforts were taken in the 16th century to revive the rite and ensure its continued presence in the city of Toledo, where it is still celebrated today."
 insular_celtic: "Celtic Catholicism" #Mainly to keep names consistent. I mean it's debatable to some whether this should even exist anyway regardless of what it's called.
 insular_celtic_adj: "Celtic Catholic"
 insular_celtic_adherent: "Celticist"
 insular_celtic_adherent_plural: "Celticists"
 insular_celtic_desc: "A rural church that drifted away from Roman Catholic orthodoxy some centuries ago, Celtic Catholicism has lost many of its once-distinctive features at the insistence of its mother-church. It yet retains a greater emphasis on penance and monasticism, and incorporates many traditional Celtic marriage customs foreign to wider Christendom.\n\nThe term Celtic Church is deprecated by many historians as it implies a unified and identifiable entity entirely separate from that of mainstream Western Christendom. For this reason, many prefer the term Insular Christianity due to misconceptions that the Roman and Celtic Church were opposed to each other. However, many modern scholars outright reject the existence of the Church regardless of its name due to the lack of substantiating evidence."
 coptic:0 "Coptic Orthodoxy"
 coptic_adj:0 "Coptic Orthodox"
 coptic_adherent:0 "Copt"
 coptic_adherent_plural:0 "Copts"
 coptic_desc: "Coptic Christianity, also known as the Coptic Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria, finds its roots in the apostolic teachings of Saint Mark during the 1st century. Serving as the predominant Christian denomination in medieval Egypt, the Coptic Orthodox Church upholds a unique liturgical tradition, employing the ancient Coptic language in its worship practices. Adherents uphold the Nicene Creed and honor the Councils of Nicaea and Ephesus. The Coptic Church is famous for both being the birthplace of Christian monasticism as well as maintaining a long tradition of the promotion of education and philosophy."
 armenian_apostolic_desc: "Armenian Apostolic Christianity, one of the world's oldest Christian traditions, traces its origins to the Apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew in the early 1st century. Firmly rooted in Armenia's history, this ancient faith, officially known as the Armenian Apostolic Church, boasts a distinctive liturgical heritage and language, with liturgy conducted in Classical Armenian. The Armenian Apostolic Church rapidly gained followers in the region and shepherded the Kingdom of Armenia into becoming the first state ever to adopt Christianity as its official religion."
 paulician_desc: "Paulicianism is Christian Gnostic heresy influenced by Manichaeism, originating in Armenia, and known for its militarist attitude and emphasis on only accepting the New Testament as legitimate. Rejecting the divinity of Christ and viewing the veneration of the cross as heathenish, Paulicians aim to restore what they believe to be the true form of Christianity as laid out by Paul of Tarsus."
 #TENETS
 tenet_junior_patriarchate_name: "Junior Patriarchate"
 tenet_junior_patriarchate_desc: "While a place of prestige will always be set aside for the Pentarchy, there exists a need for new patriarchates to aid in the jurisdiction of the Orthodox Church."
 tenet_mission_territory_name: "Mission Territory"
 tenet_mission_territory_desc: "This faith can hardly be considered one faith, on account of it being spread over such a vast area with such little unity. It can not rightly be considered a distinct form of Christianity, but rather exists to open the floodgates to a variety of new Christian sects among a previously pagan population."
 game_concept_theology_desc: "Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine, or more broadly of religious belief. The study of theology may help a theologian more deeply understand their own religious tradition, another religious tradition, or it may enable them to explore the nature of divinity without reference to any specific tradition. Theology may be used to propagate, reform, or justify a religious tradition; or it may be used to compare, challenge (e.g. biblical criticism), or oppose (e.g. irreligion) a religious tradition or worldview. Theology might also help a theologian address some present situation or need through a religious tradition, or to explore possible ways of interpreting the world."
 game_concept_syncretic_desc: "Syncretism is the practice of combining different beliefs and various schools of thought. Syncretism involves the merging or assimilation of several originally discrete traditions, especially in the theology and mythology of religion, thus asserting an underlying unity and allowing for an inclusive approach to other faiths."

In this indigenous faith, reverence for nature, spirits, and ancestral connections played a central role. The belief system encompassed a diverse array of deities, spirits, and mythological figures associated with natural elements, celestial forces, and the cycles of life. Objects, places and people have their own guardian spirits known as Haltijas. Ukko (Äijih) was often considered the chief deity or god of the sky, thunder, and weather."

At the core of Sámi spiritual practices is the role of the "noaidi" or "nòitu," a spiritual mediator and practitioner who engages with the spirit world on behalf of the community. Central to Sámi traditional beliefs is the concept of the "duoda," a term reflecting the interconnectedness of all things, acknowledging the interdependence of the spiritual and material realms."

Erzya traditional spirituality, deeply rooted in the cultural and natural landscape of the Erzya people, reflects a rich tapestry of animistic and shamanic traditions. At the core of Erzya paganism is a reverence for the forces of nature, spirits, and deities that inhabit the world around them. Shamans, known as "šoš," play a central role in Erzya pagan practices. These spiritual intermediaries engage in rituals, trance-like states, and communing with the spirit world to seek guidance, healing, and to maintain harmony within the community. Through drumming, chanting, and other ceremonial practices, the šoš navigate the realms of the divine and act as mediators between the human and spiritual dimensions."

Through rituals, ecstatic experiences, and communication with the divine, murtads seek to maintain balance, offer guidance, and facilitate healing within the community. Ceremonial practices, including drumming, chanting, and symbolic gestures, play a crucial role in these spiritual endeavors."

They believe the world rests on the back of a large fish, which, when it moves, causes earthquakes."

Other attributes associated with Kāpālikas were that they revered the fierce Bhairava form of Shiva by emulating his behavior and characteristics, smeared their body with ashes from the cremation grounds, wore their hair long and matted, and engaged in transgressive rituals such as sexual intercourse with lower-class women, human sacrifices, consumption of meat and alcoholic beverages, and offerings involving orgiastic sexuality and sexual fluids."
