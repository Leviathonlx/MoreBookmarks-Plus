 game_concept_early_medieval1: "Early Medieval"
 game_concept_early_medieval1_desc: "The Early Middle Ages or Early Medieval Period, sometimes referred to as the Dark Ages (a term modern historians no longer use), is typically regarded by historians as lasting from the late 5th or early 6th century to the 10th century. The alternative term Late Antiquity, for the early part of the period, emphasizes elements of continuity with the Roman Empire, while Early Middle Ages is used to emphasize developments characteristic of the earlier medieval period.\n\nIn 800 the title of Emperor was revived in Western Europe with Charlemagne, whose Carolingian Empire greatly affected later European social structure and history. Europe experienced a return to systematic agriculture in the form of the feudal system, which adopted such innovations as three-field planting and the heavy plough. Barbarian migration stabilized in much of Europe, although the Viking expansion greatly affected Northern Europe.\n\nAfter Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an Islamic Golden Age, inspiring achievements in architecture, the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in medicine, algebra, geometry, astronomy, anatomy, and ethics that would later finds it way back to Western Europe."
 game_concept_high_medieval1: "High Medieval"
 game_concept_high_medieval1_desc: "The High Middle Ages, or High Medieval Period, was the period of European history that lasted from around AD 1000 to 1250. The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around AD 1500.\n\nKey historical trends of the High Middle Ages include the rapidly increasing population of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era, and the Renaissance of the 12th century, including the first developments of rural exodus and of urbanization. By 1250, the robust population increase had greatly benefited the European economy, which reached levels that would not be seen again in some areas until the 19th century. That trend faltered during the Late Middle Ages because of a series of calamities, most notably the Black Death, but also numerous wars as well as economic stagnation.\n\nIn the Middle East this was the peak of the Islamic Golden Age which traditionally ended with the collapse of the Abbasid Caliphate due to the Mongol invasion and the Siege of Baghdad."
 game_concept_late_medieval1: "Late Medieval"
 game_concept_late_medieval1_desc: "The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history lasting from AD 1250 to 1500. The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern period (and in much of Europe, the Renaissance).\n\nAround 1300, centuries of prosperity and growth in Europe came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, including the Great Famine of 1315–1317 and the Black Death, reduced the population to around half of what it had been before the calamities. Along with depopulation came social unrest and endemic warfare. France and England experienced serious peasant uprisings, such as the Jacquerie and the Peasants' Revolt, as well as over a century of intermittent conflict, the Hundred Years' War. To add to the many problems of the period, the unity of the Catholic Church was temporarily shattered by the Western Schism. Collectively, those events are sometimes called the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages.\n\nDespite the crises the 14th century was also a time of great progress in the arts and sciences. Following a renewed interest in ancient Greek and Roman texts that took root in the High Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance began. The absorption of Latin texts had started before the Renaissance of the 12th century through contact with Arabs during the Crusades, but the availability of important Greek texts accelerated with the Capture of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks, when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West, particularly Italy."

This marked the passing of the old Anglo-Saxon world and the dawn of the "English" as a new people."

By the 9th century, the Eastern Slavs were divided into various tribes who were varyingly influenced by their many neighbours before the eventual rise of the Kievan Rus.\n\nCharacterized by Byzantine and North Germanic influenced [culture|E] and their East Slavic [heritage|E], the East Slavs form the link between the [west_slavs|E] and [south_slavs|E]."

By the 9th century, most of these Lechitic tribes have established themselves in the western section of the Northern European Plain and became ever more entangled with the Frankish and Bulgarian states that surrounded them which contributed to the rise of native principalities such as Moravia or Poland.\n\nCharacterized by their Frankish influenced [culture|E] and their West Slavic [heritage|E], the West Slavs form the northern link between the [east_slavs|E] and [pannonian_slavs|E]."

While it is most likely that many Slavic peoples can trace their origin to pre-existing peoples that would come to be assimilated because of these Slavic migrations, they nevertheless considered themselves, and were considered by their neighbours, to, more or less, constitute a single people even up until the early modern period.\n\nIn the game, the Slavs are the ancestral culture of the various East, West and South and Pannonian Slavic peoples."

Styling itself as a restored Achaemenid Empire, even coming close to re-establishing the historical boundaries during final the Sassanid-Byzantine war, the Sassanid Empire was eventually left weakened after decades of war and thus became an easy target for the early Islamic Caliphate.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Islamic Conquest of Iran, the many peoples of the former empire began to slowly convert to the new religion, giving rise to new native Iranian dynasties such as the Saffarids or Samanids during the Iranian Intermezzo. Apart from being the main force behind the integration of Khwarazm and Sogdiana into the Ērānian sphere, these dynasties were also patrons of the culture and arts that gave rise to the Islamic-Persian cultural fusion.\n\nCharacterized by their Iranian [heritage|E] and various Iranian [languages|E] such as Persian, Khwarazmian or Caspian, the many descendants of the Ērānians still form the dominant group on the Iranian plateau and in Central Asia."

This shared Diutsc language would then go on to form the basis for a shared identity that made these central Europeans different from their Romance and Slavic neighbours, although it wouldn’t be until the modern period that a true sense of a shared national identity would emerge. Nevertheless, these central European Diutsc speakers would still, in spite of changing and evolving tribal identities that usually served as an umbrella term for this group, become known as a more or less single coherent people and play a crucial role in European dynastic and political history for centuries to come.\n\nCharacterized by their Frankish influenced [culture|E] and their Central Germanic [heritage|E], the Germans exist primarily within Central Europe in the territories that made up East Francia."

Over the course of Rome's history, the label came to denote more so a cultural lifestyle and legal status, rather than an actual ethnic identity, though more often than not it did take on such a form as well.\n\nCharacterized by their Greek or Latin derived [languages|E], as well as their Latin, Frankish, Iberian, Vlach, Rhaetic or (Eastern) Roman [heritages|E], the descendants of the Romans continue to constitute the majority population across much of the mediterranean."
