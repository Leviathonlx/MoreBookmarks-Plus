 balkan_flavour.0004.desc: "While my scouts were traversing the lands of Pannonia, they’ve come across the fortified town of Castei who’s inhabitants speak in a strange tongue that is unintelligible to that of the surrounding villages and informed my steward about it. \n\nCuriously enough, the townsfolk appear to differ not just in their speech but in their lifestyle too as they seem to be most talented artisans, crafting unique artifacts of all kinds, unseen in the rest of Pannonia. \nLikewise, their town is unlike many others of the area as it boasts respectable stone fortifications and a unique architecture reminiscent of long bygone times.\n\nWhile there, my scouts were approached by a local who wishes for an audience with me."

 british_flavour.0001.desc: "I scramble whatever belongings I can carry before making a run for the gate. The surrounding countryside has already been plundered and much of the land has been put to the torch. It would take a while before we get to the temporary holding of Gwovan upstream of the river. While on this journey, I reflect on what had happened. \n\nThe Fortress of [GetTitleByKey('c_lennox').GetNameNoTier] has finally been sacked. Those who didn’t manage to escape the siege have either been killed or captured by the invaders. I can only imagine the horror of those who didn’t make it. \n\n As we arrive at Gwovan, it becomes increasingly clear that we won’t return to [GetTitleByKey('b_dumbarton').GetNameNoTier] in the foreseeable future. The old castle is merely a ruin now and easy picking for any outside invaders. We will have to make do with what we have left, and as such, the Kingdom of [GetTitleByKey('d_galloway').GetNameNoTier], the final bastion of the Hen Ogledd, is no more.

 #Iranian Flavor Events
 iranian_flavour.0001.t: "The Rise of Adharestan"
 iranian_flavour.0001.desc: "In ancient times, the North-Western lands of Iran were inhabited by various peoples, namely the Medes, Cadusians and Albanians, among others. When the Achaemenid Empire fell, Atropates, the Satrap of Media, continued to rule the north of the former satrapy that would come to be known as Atropatene.\n\nSince then, the locals have been heavily Eranianized and Persianized, bringing forth the various Adhari tribes that live there today; Long divided between various tribal polities, or ruled by foreign lords with no ties to the land, I have finally managed to bring the area under my rule, consolidating it into a single political entity.\n\nNo longer shall we be subject to foreigners, but rule the land ourselves. Just like Atropates before me, so too shall I forge a strong and independent Adharestan that shall stand the test of time!"
 iranian_flavour.0001.a: "Atropates would be proud."
 iranian_flavour.0001.b: "Eran is not yet lost!"
 
 iranian_flavour.0002.t: "The Talyshi People"
 iranian_flavour.0002.desc: "Talysh has been inhabited by Iranians since ancient times; Once known as Cadusians, the land has been ruled by various Empires and Dynasties who varyingly influenced the local culture, giving rise to Deilami, Adhari, Gilaki and more.\n\nWith our recent policy of solidifying the area under a single political entity, the locals have started to once again shift their identity towards a new Talyshi one."
 iranian_flavour.0002.a: "We should promote this trend!"
 iranian_flavour.0002.b: "They are the same people as they were before."
 
 british_culture.0002.t: "The Rise of the Anglecynn"
 british_culture.0002.desc: "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, various Germanic tribes began to migrate to the British Isles, among them the Jutes, Angles and Saxons who would go on to form their own petty kingdoms across much of the land they settled. After a lengthy period of expansion against the native Britons and consolidation of surrounding tribes, Kingdoms like Kent, Mercia and Northumbria would gradually start to forge new regional cultures unique to the isle with their own dialects and identities. This would slowly change with the Viking invasion that saw fall of many of these old kingdoms in rapid succession with the rest gradually being absorbed into what would later become England. As such, a new culture has begun to emerge, one that is defined by the shared faith, origin and tongue of these native Germanics of Britain, that stands in a contrast to those from across the sea. At last, these people have started to see themselves no longer as Mercians, West Saxons or Kents, but as a common English people."
 british_culture.0002.a: "This will change the course of history."
 
 british_culture.0003.t: "The Reformation of Pengwern"
 british_culture.0003.desc: "A long time ago, much of the midlands was ruled by the House of Pengwern until decentralization and foreign invasion brought the kingdom to its knees. \n\nWhile the exact location of the Court of Pengwern has been lost to time, we know that it once ruled a sizeable chunk of territory stretching from Powys to the Severn, possibly even extending as far south as the Channel of Bristol. However, when the rural communities of Powys began to assert their independence and the Mercians began to encroach from the east, the Kingdom eventually got subsumed and forgotten.\n\nBut at last, my house has managed to regain the lost territories of Ergyng, Pengwern and Powys, pushing the Angles beyond the Severn. \nWith Pengwern back in British hands, it is only a matter of time until we subjugate the last of the rebellious Anglish who once tried to contain us in the mountainous lands of Cambria; soon all of Britain will swear their oaths of loyalty to my house!"
 british_culture.0003.a: "Rise, Heirs of Pengwern!"
 
 british_culture.0011.t: "The Divergence of Brythonic"
 british_culture.0011.desc: "Since the Fall of Caergloui to the Anglo-Saxons, the Britons of Britannia and Brittany have slowly but steadily diverged from one another. After centuries of relative isolation, two unique Brittonic varieties have emerged from the dialects of Dumnonia and Cambria respectively: while both continue to identify as Brythonic, the variety of each area has become largely unintelligible to the other."
 british_culture.0011.a: "Brythonwyr o hyd!"
 
 balkan_culture.0002.t: "A Bosnian People"
 balkan_culture.0002.desc: "When the Kingdom of Bosnia was established, not many could have imagined the renaissance it would bring; Independent from both Serbia and Croatia, the people of the Central Dinaric Alps and along the Bosna River have begun to see themselves as neither Serb nor Croat, but as a new and distinct Bosnian people with their own culture and heritage, both founded in our very kingdom. "

 balkan_culture.0004.desc: "When the Slavs first migrated into the Balkans in the 6th century, they consisted of many disparate tribes who were simply fleeing from the invading Avars. \n\nBut since we united the lands of Illyria, the tribes have grown quite accustomed to one another; poets and intellectuals from across the known world travel to the Illyrian court, contributing to an emerging Slavonic Renaissance. It is under the stability of my realm that the Illyrian people have finally developed a common identity that transcends the old tribal boundaries.\n\nThus, it is only fitting that we should foster this emerging sense of unity and develop it into something truly new and lasting."

In the aftermath of their demise, the land was subsequently occupied by peoples such as the Goths, Lombards, Avars and lastly us [pannonian_founder.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip]s.  \n\nBut now, after countless centuries, I have managed to reunite these lands under a single banner. My authority stretches from the vital forts of [GetTitleByKey('b_sisak').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('b_vakovo').GetNameNoTier] on the river Sava to the ancient town of [GetTitleByKey('b_gyor').GetNameNoTier] on the river Danube.

Ever since its fall to the Roman Republic in the 2nd century BC, Illyria has remained under the yoke of foreign rule, changing hands between various Roman usurpers, Germanic invaders and finally Slavic chiefs and princes.\n\nBut at last, I have managed what not even Pleuratus could’ve dreamed of: I have united Illyria under a single crown, brought together its many tribes under a common banner.
