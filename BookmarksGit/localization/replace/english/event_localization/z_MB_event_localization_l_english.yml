 iranian_flavour.0001.desc: "In ancient times, the North-Western lands of Iran were inhabited by various peoples, namely the Medes, Cadusians and Albanians, among others. When the Achaemenid Empire fell, Atropates, the Satrap of Media, continued to rule the north of the former satrapy that would come to be known as Atropatene.\n\nSince then, the locals have been heavily Eranianized and Persianized, bringing forth the various Adhari tribes that live there today; Long divided between various tribal polities, or ruled by foreign lords with no ties to the land, I have finally managed to bring the area under my rule, consolidating it into a single political entity.\n\nNo longer shall we be subject to foreigners, but rule the land ourselves. Just like Atropates before me, so too shall I forge a strong and independent Adharestan that shall stand the test of time!"

 iranian_flavour.0002.desc: "Talysh has been inhabited by Iranians since ancient times; Once known as Cadusians, the land has been ruled by various Empires and Dynasties who varyingly influenced the local culture, giving rise to Deilami, Adhari, Gilaki and more.\n\nWith our recent policy of solidifying the area under a single political entity, the locals have started to once again shift their identity towards a new Talyshi one."
 iranian_flavour.0002.a: "We should promote this trend!"
 iranian_flavour.0002.b: "They are the same people as they were before."
 
 british_culture.0002.t: "The Rise of the Anglecynn"
 british_culture.0002.desc: "After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, various Germanic tribes began to migrate to the British Isles, among them the Jutes, Angles and Saxons who would go on to form their own petty kingdoms across much of the land they settled. After a lengthy period of expansion against the native Britons and consolidation of surrounding tribes, Kingdoms like Kent, Mercia and Northumbria would gradually start to forge new regional cultures unique to the isle with their own dialects and identities. This would slowly change with the Viking invasion that saw fall of many of these old kingdoms in rapid succession with the rest gradually being absorbed into what would later become England. As such, a new culture has begun to emerge, one that is defined by the shared faith, origin and tongue of these native Germanics of Britain, that stands in a contrast to those from across the sea. At last, these people have started to see themselves no longer as Mercians, West Saxons or Kents, but as a common English people."
 british_culture.0002.a: "This will change the course of history."
 
 british_culture.0003.t: "The Reformation of Pengwern"
 british_culture.0003.desc: "A long time ago, much of the midlands was ruled by the House of Pengwern until decentralization and foreign invasion brought the kingdom to its knees. \n\nWhile the exact location of the Court of Pengwern has been lost to time, we know that it once ruled a sizeable chunk of territory stretching from Powys to the Severn, possibly even extending as far south as the Channel of Bristol. However, when the rural communities of Powys began to assert their independence and the Mercians began to encroach from the east, the Kingdom eventually got subsumed and forgotten.\n\nBut at last, my house has managed to regain the lost territories of Ergyng, Pengwern and Powys, pushing the Angles beyond the Severn. \nWith Pengwern back in British hands, it is only a matter of time until we subjugate the last of the rebellious Anglish who once tried to contain us in the mountainous lands of Cambria; soon all of Britain will swear their oaths of loyalty to my house!"
 british_culture.0003.a: "Rise, Heirs of Pengwern!"
 
 british_culture.0011.t: "The Divergence of Brythonic"
 british_culture.0011.desc: "Since the Fall of Caergloui to the Anglo-Saxons, the Britons of Britannia and Brittany have slowly but steadily diverged from one another. After centuries of relative isolation, two unique Brittonic varieties have emerged from the dialects of Dumnonia and Cambria respectively: while both continue to identify as Brythonic, the variety of each area has become largely unintelligible to the other."

 balkan_culture.0002.desc: "When the Kingdom of Bosnia was established, not many could have imagined the renaissance it would bring; Independent from both Serbia and Croatia, the people of the Central Dinaric Alps and along the Bosna River have begun to see themselves as neither Serb nor Croat, but as a new and distinct Bosnian people with their own culture and heritage, both founded in our very kingdom.

It is under the stability of my realm that the Illyrian people have finally developed a common identity that transcends the old tribal boundaries.\n\nThus, it is only fitting that we should foster this emerging sense of unity and develop it into something truly new and lasting."
